8zr5u3,"I've always chewed my nails, but I never knew it was because of my anxiety. I always thought it was just a habit I never managed to kick. So I tried Sertraline, which made my anxiety 10x worse. Then my doctor switched me to Effexor, of which I am now taking 150mg qday (increase from 75) because my anxiety is skyrocketing again. Nothing has really changed in my work or social life, but I feel like I am constantly on the verge of a panic attack. My mood swings are much closer to the surface. I feel like I did before I started on medication: close to a mental breakdown. I’m hoping the dose increase helps, although I am worried about withdrawal later down the line. I missed a couple of doses and had some withdrawal symptoms, so I’m not really looking forward to eventually getting off of it.

8zgg5h,"So I've been on Effexor XR for 8 years or so.  I started on 75mg, and then about 4 years ago dropped down to 37.5mg

Back in January I had a reaction to a steroid (didn't know that's what caused the issue immediately)  and since I didn't know exactly what was happening, I thought I might be stating to develop an allergy to my effexor.  So I did a bunch of research online and decided to try to taper off of it using the 10% drop of the previous dose taper method.  I was down to taking 72.9% of 37.5mg, or about 27.5mg, when I got REALLY bad withdrawal symptoms.  This was about a month ago.  My anxiety, which is the main reason I was prescribed effexor xr in the first place, also came back.  So I decided to just stay on it.  I just started taking the 37.5mg again.  It seems like ever since then though, that I have a a pretty constant headache.  It's mainly in my temples, my eyes and the base of my skull in the back of my head.  My blood pressure has risen a bit (nothing horrible usually, 150/100 is the highest I've recorded), I have had diarrhea the past week or so.  Today, I went to mow my lawn and had to stop halfway through cause I thought I was going to pass out.  That's never happened before.  I also had a slight fever of 99.2.  I sometimes have some nausea/light headedness, and I want to do nothing but sleep.   I haven't had any of the horrible muscle spasms or jerking that I have seen some people have with it.  

I made an appointment with my dr, but the earliest they said they can get me in is august 21st.  I may call them back tomorrow and try to get in earlier.  

I'm scared to death that I've done irreparable damage to myself by just going back to the 37.5mg and these symptoms won't go away.  I don't know why that would be though, as when I first started taking the med 8 years ago I started off from 0, to 75mg and had literally no side effects except it got rid of my anxiety.  Is it really possible that going from 27.5 to 37.5mg is causing me all these issues?

8zg3hu,"I know that just about anything that interacts with serotonin has reduced efficacy at best and is dangerous at worst when mixed with SSRIs, but since I've started Effexor (which is a SNRI, but I don't think any psychedelics work through norepiphrenine so that's besides the point) stopping for a bit before tripping isn't really an option- the withdrawal makes everything shitty. I'm wondering if there's any other sort of psychedelic RCs that might work better while taking this sort of medication.

 I do get some amount of visuals with lysergamides and tryptamines, and could probably just try increasing the dose- but I don't really want to get serotonin poisoning. Any thoughts?",withdrawal

8zbap8,"I have been taking Cipralex for almost two years now, having bumped up to 20mg about four months ago. I have been wanting to come off of it for a while because I have had awful crashes whenever I have increased my dose (however, doc recommended I try maxing it out first). Now, I've been feeling good and pretty steady, however I have really noticed a significant decrease in sexual interest and function as soon as the 20mg started taking effect, so much so that I want to try something else or stop taking antidepressants altogether for a while in hopes that my libido will return. I have been doing some reading and have heard good things about Effexor, Pristiq, and Trintellix in terms of side effects in general (aside from withdrawal from Effexor). Just wondering what experiences people have had with any or experiences with discontinuing antidepressants. Thank you!

For reference, I am a 23 y/o female doing her Master's degree. It is usually a one year program which I have opted to do in two years instead, so my stress levels will overall be much lower in the upcoming year (compared to the time I have been taking Cipralex so far). I have tried Wellbutrin in combination with Cipralex to increase motivation and energy, but had an allergic reaction to it (still disappointed). ",decrease in sexual interest and function

8y7dy7,"I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for basically as long as I can remember in my 24 year lifespan though the first time I can consciously remember being like yup this is that was when I was 11. But that's not important, what's important is that last December I finally went to my doctor and tried to get medicated. Since December I've been on 3 different medications to treat my brain, cipralex for 4.5 months and it made me sleep 18 hours a day, Effexor for 4.5 weeks that either did jack shit or made it worse because I was suicidal and I got off that ASAP when I realized I was just sitting there trying to figure out how to kill myself without making anyone sad, and now Prozac for the last 2ish weeks. Now you may be thinking ah worst 2 weeks, 2 weeks on Prozac, maybe some relation? Not as far as I know, this is all just background, setting the stage. 

So 2 weeks ago, on June 29 I switched meds from the Effexor to Prozac. For 3 days I experienced some hellish withdrawal symptoms or something because I felt like I was drunk off my ass while standing on a boat in the middle of a hurricane. On July 3, my boyfriend and I broke up after just over a year together. It was mutual, it was amicable, but I was still devastated and  was basically catatonic, not able to do anything without sobbing for 2-3 days. I went through 3 boxes of Kleenex. When I finally got a bit of a handle on that I went back to trying to function and finally checked my email again while working on yet another draft of my current chapter for my masters thesis. It was then that I discovered on the 2nd my advisor had communicated with my schools admin and told them I needed to be put on medical leave. Now I know my work for the last god knows how long has been subpar, sleeping 18 hours a day, being suicidal, and/or being too anxious to function will do that, so here I am feeling as if I'm the biggest disappointment and failure. I eventually come to realize no, this is the absolute best thing I could do right now, take the rest of the semester, move back home, get my head on straight, work on my self care and have a plan and really come back and just kill it. So I started filling out the paperwork and getting all the signatures I needed, all of admin was incredibly understanding and kind and helpful. Then it comes time to get my advisors signature. Turns out she actually wants to drop me from my MSc. She's is currently ""deciding"" if she's going to put me down for permanent or temporary withdrawal from my masters as she believes that a month and a half will not be enough time for me to get my shit together and her funding for my project will run out in the new year. I understand where she's coming from with the funding thing, I do, but I've spent the last 2 years working on this thesis and if she forces me to drop to the course based masters, I'm still at least 2 semesters from being done, I still have to keep paying tuition and taking more courses, and then all of a sudden the work I've done just gets downgraded from a thesis that I've poured my heart and soul into for 2 years into a ""project"". I suggested I could come back part time instead of full time so she's no longer obligated to pay me. Because her funding would run out and she needs results from that she'd give my thesis topic to someone else to completely redo and write, on top of their own work, and I would have to start over. She'd rather give my masters thesis topic to someone who is already working on their Phd than give me a chance to prove to her that I can finish it.

I'm currently just waiting to find out if she'll believe in me or not. Now I'm not saying I necessarily deserve belief, I have been incredibly disappointing to her and myself, but why is it that everyone else is understanding just not her? This isn't even uncommon apparently, I don't even need to provide medical proof admin will just take it at face value, but all of a sudden one and a half months of not working makes the difference between being able to finish or not?

I usually don't like my dad being in my life, but we discussed my history of Anxiety, depression, Aspergers and Tourettes.  

Before seeing a new doctor, I had been on Effexor (150 MGs) for about 2 years prior and been happy with it. It doesn't nessesarily make me happier, but it numbs it and helps me sleep a lot.  


I went from 150 of Effexor to what he prescribed me with Cymbalta (Which I was on 100 MGs for a month). Which, like the other drugs, never really did anything (this is why I like SSRI's, because they're more aggressive). A month later (AKA a week ago) we decided to try Pristiq. Apparently the FDA is iffy on letting it by covered by most health insurance companies.  

  
I know it's only been a week and I need to give it more time, however, I've been getting the disorientation, mild brain-zaps and dizziness when standing and walking. Is anyone here an expert on Pristiq? Can I just jump start to 100 MG's without any side effects? I can't stand being on this low of a dose.

8y2ghj,"Hello all,

I’ve been taking Effexor XR 150mg for a few years now, had worsening depression and anxiety for the last few months so a new psych that I visited upped my Effexor to another 75mg in the afternoon and added Gabapentin 100mg three times daily. 

I’ve been taking the increased Effexor dose for about a month without seeing many side effects. However, I just started taking the Gabapentin a few days ago and am not sure what to think. The first day I felt very groggy and out of it, but definitely decreased anxiety. However, the following few days I actually felt hyper...almost manic and keyed-up. Definitely not what I want from an anti-anxiety standpoint haha. Not sure what this means considering it makes almost everyone drowsy...weird reaction to the Gaba or the mix of Effexor+Gaba? 

Any of you redditors have a lot of experience with Gabapentin? Preferably for anxiety/mood, not for pain. ",groggy

8zydgi,"I just took my first ever drug (Vyvanse 50mg) to complete some summer school work and take my finals for it but it had a really large effect that I didn’t expect.

I took and waited about 45 mins when I finally realized I was prioritizing homework over other things so that was my cue to go and do some stuff. I worked for a solid few hours and suddenly got a huge urge to go and talk to my mom.

For the rest of the night probably 4 or 5 hours I sat and had a great deep conversation with my mom that ended up with her crying in a good way and it became very emotional. I took a shower and ended up having a deep loving talk with my girlfriend and I finally finished up all my homework. I ended up going and sitting in my bed and just realizing how much I loved life. Before I took Vyvanse I had just a mediocre outlook on life and would get depressed occasionally but I’m mostly emotionally and mentally stable. I wasn’t too knowledgeable on Vyvanse but i fell asleep on it and woke up still effected.

That day even after the come down (which I didn’t feel at all, extremely smooth) I had a completely different outlook on life and I completely changed my way of thinking on humanity. This new way of thinking has stuck with me and I can’t help but think that maybe it’s only me that had such a great experience. I’ll be trying it again for the next time I need finals because I know how addictive it is mentally.

I know this experience will eventually go away but I hope my tolerance never increases considering I will only take it very occasionally. Has anyone else experienced Vyvanse or any other drug like it (adderall) like that?",addictive

But instead of doing my work i find i spend almost an hour on less important things (especially washing my face, doing little things ive been putting off like cleaning parts of my room), and then i get panicky that im not doing my real work. 

It also makes me think of all the things ive been trying to do, and messes up my emotional state a bit esp my anxiety

TL;DR: im finally able to physically do all the things in my head, but my mind is still racing so it just means i switch tasks every 10 minutes, which is frustrating/stressful. Does this mean im taking too much or too little? (or do i just need to work on my planning?)",panick

I've read that it's pretty common to have a suppressed appetite, and I definitely experienced the same in past \[pre-diagnosis\] use of ritalin and nicotine. 

So is it plausible to make gains if you have to slog through a meal at Lunch, without eating heavily prior to a drug taking effect or right at the end of the day? 

Usually my issue with actually exercising is being too disorganised or anxious, so I'm wondering if I need to be particularly careful while on meds or if muscular exercises are futile or needed to prevent atrophy.

8yxzgg,"Hey there

I was recently put on vyvanse by my psychiatrist at a long term addictions aftercare facility. 

I abused alcohol and cocaine throughout my early 20s. I also used to buy adderall illegally and take large quantities. My psych knows about all of this. I am also in 12 step recovery at the moment and dont want to jeopardize my recovery. 

We decided to try vyvanse as I had previously used it (without a prescription) when I was in university. I recall feeling ""normal"" and just able to function. It also lessened my desire to drink and use. 

Yesterday I took my first dose and it scared me a bit to feel mild euphoria. I didnt continue today as Im worried about once again chasing the dragon. While it did feel somewhat euphoric, it wasnt a good feeling. 

I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this. Being in recovery and taking vyvanse under a doctor's supervision.   

Im also wondering if the mild euphoria disappears after continued use. In my experience there is a difference between the feel good effects of vyvanse and the focus effects. Im just trying to manage this debilitating disorder. 

Thanks!

I was prescribed 50mg of Vyvanse to start, and I can say the first day was eye opening. I never felt so motivated to work and I've never been so happy to do it. The second day comes and it is not so great. I get a ridiculous migraine and and my blood pressure just rises like crazy. I go to urgent care and they explain to me that my doctor prescribed too high of a dose to start with and that I need to stop until I see him again. It really helped so much to finally want to pay attention and work, but now I'm afraid that other stimulant medication will not work. Does anyone have any experience or advice?

with my current insurance it's expensive - basically a visit to the md and the prescription is about $410 a month.  

So I stopped taking it again about 2 weeks ago, trying to decide if i want to continue.  I Had off for a few days over 4th of July, figures that was a good time to try this.  and then didn't start taking it again this week.

Or do amphetamines appear to cause premature aging due to people neglecting their health because of the amphetamines? So in other words, are we seeing that amphetamines have an indirect affect on aging due to the users not taking care of themselves?

8ybc3o,"I posted this in another group and was directed here....I am new to reddit. I am looking for advice from anyone who has been married to a hypersexual bipolar person. I literally have no one to talk to about my situation. At the outset, I guess it is important to know that husband was diagnosed as bipolar 1 a year and a half ago (he is 44). I guess we kind of knew he was bipolar before then, but avoided facing the situation.

So here's my (long) circuitous story....

When my husband and I were first dating, he had what I thought to be a REALLY high sex drive...but we were single, and I found it it fun and exciting. We got married (this was now 13 years ago), and a year or so after we were married I noticed that my husband appeared to have ADD....so he went and got diagnosed, and was put on Adderall and max dose of Vyvanse. It seemed to help him stay on track, which was great. At some point the doctor noted that he also seemed to cycle into depression, so his PCP put him on sertraline. What I then found was cross dressing stuff and that he was mastrubating all the time, filming himself masturbating, etc. I would confront it, and he would lie about it. We would have wicked fights about it. He would want to have sex all the time, but I felt almost objectified.....like I was just an outlet for him. I started to withdraw, and I have to be honest and say that I found the cross dressing thing REALLY hard to accept - I have always been pretty easy going sexually, but it just bothered me. No offense to anyone who is cool with it - it just isn't my thing.

My husband then added really excessive drinking to the picture. It was so bad that at times he would mutter while walking around in a stupor. At some point, my husband's doctor clued in that my husband could be bipolar and that the sertaline was making his manic episodes worse, and switched his anti-depressant. This seemed to control the cross dressing and hypersexuality a bit....or maybe it was dwarfed by the drinking. Idk. Anyway fast forward to the end of 2016, my husband gets picked up for a DUI at 2 in the morning driving around in a rental car drinking vodka and blows a .28. I tell him I am done and that he has to move out and get some real psych help. He goes right away to a shrink, is diagnosed as bipolar 1 and seroquel is added to the picture. He quits drinking altogether (which is great)....I never follow through on making him move out.

Since that time, my husband has generally been more stable. But he honestly isn't able to handle much other than his work. He is difficult to be with since he tends to only talk about work or politics. He loves our kids but I manage everything and he and I never really ""connect."" All of our acquaintances (we have no couple friends) are now pretty far in their careers and are going places, talking about their plans for the future. I can talk to him about these things but there really never isn't a ""dialogue."" There is no connection.

Over the past few months, I have felt in my gut that something was going on again. For you wives or husbands of bipolars, maybe you know what I mean? I could feel it in my gut that something was up. I found two trash cans full of sex stuff in his office - dildos, womens undergarments full of streaks of feces, tape on boobs, etc. Outside of wanting to vomit in my mouth, I get super upset and scream and yell, etc. I check his pills and find out he isn't taking them. He goes back to the shrink and she ups the Seroquel to 300 mg. Two weeks go by, and I find he was ""back at it"" again last night. I throw his plate of food at him and it breaks against the wall, the kids are crying, and I tell him I am done....he is out.

From the outside we are ""normal"" people. I am a lawyer and he is an engineer, we have three kids, etc. But inside our home it is just out of control. Every time an issue arises he says he fell off the ""deep end"" again, he is sorry, he doesn't know what is wrong with him, etc. But it is just like the show Groundhog Day....the same thing over and over again. Is this really as good as it gets while medicated? Is a ""normal"" life even possible (admitting that normalcy is subject to interpretation)? Can the mood swings be managed with medication? I feel so bad about this situation, especially for my kids who are now heartbroken, but I just don't think that I am able to handle this anymore if this is as good as it is going to get.",depression

8y4uhx,"Hello you crazy r/stims freaks,

I'm a simple man with a simple question. I have a choice to make : Vyvanse, Adderall, or Ritalin. These are the three pharma stims I could potentially get my hands on, from reputable DN lads. 

I'm looking to get a couple of pills to help me occasionally boost my walnut sized brain. I need something to help stimulate my mind in order to come up with creative bullshit faster than the other guys at my ad agency/design studio. I'm talking about a once a month type of thing. Something to help me focus, for a good 4-6 hours of ""brainstorming"" as we call it. 

If possible, I'd like not to fuck up my brain chemistry, and also I'd like to have a smooth/minimal comedown experience. I've heard Adderall is stronger but more intense and prone to harder comedowns. I've read that Ritalin is meh but does the job fairly well. And I've read fuck-all about Vyvanse (or I mean, people have very different opinions of it).

Which stim is best for my dumb ass? Which dosage for a (relatively) healthy 21 year old cunt like me? 

Final note : I've done cocaine a handful of times, it's great, but too intense for this purpose and the comedown is difficult, so that's out of the question. 

Cheers and have a great wank",comedown

8y30wh,"26 years old, 210 pounds, 5'11, Male, Vyvanse 30mg Daily, Not a smoker, No current known medical issues (family is known to have heart problems), issue is just from today. Resting heart rate (from watch) seems to be floating around 88-92.

My diet from yesterday was pure awful, some soda and the better part of a large cheese pizza.

I have had an anal fissure in the past, so the wiping didn't really bother me. I did find it odd though that there doesn't seem to be much blood in the stool, just from wiping. I only got a little worried when I tasted blood in my mouth. It was brief and after drinking some water the taste has now gone away, but I just wanted to check and see if this matches up with anything.

What I'm assuming is that it is somehow related to what I ate yesterday being awful, combined with me taking an additional 30mg of Vyvanse today (which I have been told by my doctor is okay to do on occasion).

Overall, I'm not too worried, but would like to know if it sounds like anything could be going on. I'll admit I could have just thought I tasted blood because I saw it (brains are weird) but w/e. Other than these symptoms nothing else seems off. Maybe just the smallest bit of light headedness, but that is something I have come to expect with Vyvanse.

8xyxz9,"So about a month ago i picked up 16 20mg Vyvanse pills from a guy i work with. I thought they were adderall pills at the time but i didn't mind when i found out they were vyvanse because it was still cheap. 

I had a buddy over and he wanted to do some with me. It was a Saturday night and we had nothing better to do so he took 60mg and i took 120mg. It was the extended release pills so it took a long time to kick in and even when it did kick in, it wasn't intense at first so we took more. 

My buddy took one more pill to put his Vyvanse mg count at 80mg. It was his first time trying it. It was my 2nd time trying it, but the first time i tried it was years ago, so i didnt have a tolerance either. After a couple hours my buddy needed to go home because he needed to study for an exam that took place the following Monday. 

Once he left i started watching porn because i felt slightly horny. Then about an hour later it really started kicking in hard. I was horny as fuck. I was watching all these gagging and throat fucking videos, and these hot chicks gargling and salivating on hard dick was really turning me on beyond belief. So i took 5 more pills to bring my total for the night to 220mgs. 

After the other 5 pills kicked in i was dangerously horny. To the point i thought i was going to die from horniness. I was so goddamn horny that i watched porn and wacked off for 13 hours straight. 13. Fucking. Hours. 

I'm thinking they should make a film called ""13 Hours"" and have it be similar to ""127 Hours"" except be about my 13 hours of sexually obsessed nonstop porn watching and how i had to cut my own arm off because i couldn't stop wacking off. 

When i was done jerking and porn surfing my buddy sent me a text about how he just jerked off nonstop for the last 8 hours. The text triggered the horniness in me and i watched some more porn and jerked off again. 

My dick was bleeding all over. It had at least 6 blisters on it from what i remember and i still have some of the scabs on it. 

Moral to the story, for the sake of your dick skin, don't do a high dose of stimulants. ",tolerance
8xyxz9,"So about a month ago i picked up 16 20mg Vyvanse pills from a guy i work with. I thought they were adderall pills at the time but i didn't mind when i found out they were vyvanse because it was still cheap.

I was recently prescribed 40 mg of Vyvanse for ADHD. I have loved my experience mentally with the medicine. **However** I am having very low blood pressure and a high pulse on it. My blood pressure is around 87/62 and my pulse is generally around 110 bpm. I eat regularly (I set timers on my phone) and I'm drink around 90 -100 fl oz a day. Nothing I do, eating a lot of salty foods or drinking gatorade, seems to really boost my blood pressure. I also get very very cold on the medicine, to the point where I have to sit outside in 90 degree weather with a blanket. 

I read online that a Beta Blocker can help bring down a high heart rate but it also reduces blood pressure, and with my blood pressure being so low, I don't know if that's an option. Everything online about stimulants say they raise your bp. 

I don't want to go off the medicine; I am basically non-functional off it but I'm really worried about my heart.

I was diagnosed something liked 2 years ago, and as its standard, was prescribed Concerta.  it calmed my brain down a bit. Gave me the ability to not blurt out every inappropriate thought that crossed my mind whether I wanted to our not. I didn't realise at first, because it developed slowly and I thought it was just stress, but I'm now allergic to it.

My prescription was changed without warning to Xenidate(supposedly identical to Concerta but 30&#37; cheaper, and the NHS has to save money wherever it can) and holy crap, that was nothing but what I thought were side effects -

•tight throat 

•stiff, aching jaw 

•swollen tongue(to the point that the only thing I could do was stick it out of my mouth) 

•eyes that constantly felt gummed up(so I'm constantly trying to get non-existent stuff out of them) 

•constant feeling that my eyelashes are interlocking in the corners(a sensation I hate so much that I actually plucked a few to try to stop it)

•every joint uncomfortable(so constant neck and knuckle cracking to try and make it feel better) 

•congested airways 

•hyperfixation through the roof 

•complete inability to block out sound

•irritability to the point of wanting to throttle anyone having a conversation in another room if I could hear them and was trying to concentrate on something else.

So I went to my GP, who read my list of symptoms, was too professional to say ""you too, huh? One more for the anti-Xenidate file..."", but didn't need to hear more than ""I'm having some bad reactions-"" to re-prescribe Concerta.

Only the ""side effects"" didn't go away. They were better for a while, then got worse. So I started taking cetrizine hydrochloride with my Concerta, and that damped the symptoms down for a bit, but they overcame that and got stronger again.

So, next medication review, I'm put onto Elvanse(aka Vyvanse). It didn't really seem to do anything, positive or negative, until I noticed my throat starting to close up again.

The doctor decides to try something else - Atomoxetine(Strattera), which isn't a stimulant at all. Dear God, is it ever not a stimulant. I felt like my bones had been filled with lead. It completely wiped me out a couple of hours after taking it, and also gave me insomnia. Which, y'know, is just not fair. I struggled through a couple of weeks on that, establishing with experimentation that if I took it at 3 in the afternoon it did the least damage, and I wasn't snapping awake at 4 or 5 in the morning. But I didn't see any actual *benefits*.

So, off that one, and now I'm taking Medikinet. And cetrizine hydrochloride. Because my throat is closing up, my eyes are dry, my bones all feel like they're slightly in the wrong place, I want to bite the head off anyone who drags my attention away from whatever I'm trying to get on with...

According to the psychotherapist, this drug is pretty much my last option. I really, really hope she means it's the last one my NHS foundation will fund. I'm willing to try going private if it means there are more options I can explore.

Tl;dr - I've gone through all the NHS-funded medication options. Methylphenidate works but I'm allergic to it, dextroamphetamine doesn't seem to be much better, atomoxetine did bugger all except give me a different set of intolerable side effects.

•constant feeling that my eyelashes are interlocking in the corners(a sensation I hate so much that I actually plucked a few to try to stop it)

•every joint uncomfortable(so constant neck and knuckle cracking to try and make it feel better) 

•congested airways 

•hyperfixation through the roof 

•complete inability to block out sound

•irritability to the point of wanting to throttle anyone having a conversation in another room if I could hear them and was trying to concentrate on something else.

So I went to my GP, who read my list of symptoms, was too professional to say ""you too, huh? One more for the anti-Xenidate file..."", but didn't need to hear more than ""I'm having some bad reactions-"" to re-prescribe Concerta.

Only the ""side effects"" didn't go away. They were better for a while, then got worse. So I started taking cetrizine hydrochloride with my Concerta, and that damped the symptoms down for a bit, but they overcame that and got stronger again.

So, next medication review, I'm put onto Elvanse(aka Vyvanse). It didn't really seem to do anything, positive or negative, until I noticed my throat starting to close up again.

The doctor decides to try something else - Atomoxetine(Strattera), which isn't a stimulant at all. Dear God, is it ever not a stimulant. I felt like my bones had been filled with lead. It completely wiped me out a couple of hours after taking it, and also gave me insomnia. Which, y'know, is just not fair. I struggled through a couple of weeks on that, establishing with experimentation that if I took it at 3 in the afternoon it did the least damage, and I wasn't snapping awake at 4 or 5 in the morning. But I didn't see any actual *benefits*.

So, off that one, and now I'm taking Medikinet. And cetrizine hydrochloride. Because my throat is closing up, my eyes are dry, my bones all feel like they're slightly in the wrong place, I want to bite the head off anyone who drags my attention away from whatever I'm trying to get on with...

According to the psychotherapist, this drug is pretty much my last option. I really, really hope she means it's the last one my NHS foundation will fund. I'm willing to try going private if it means there are more options I can explore.

Tl;dr - I've gone through all the NHS-funded medication options. Methylphenidate works but I'm allergic to it, dextroamphetamine doesn't seem to be much better, atomoxetine did bugger all except give me a different set of intolerable side effects.

Can anyone help? Or at least commiserate?",insomnia

So I don't know if it's a blood sugar thing or a just general overall too low a dose of Vyvanse, but lately I have been a lot more irritated and impulsive.


So I did the dumbest thing ever: I created a post saying ""anyone else getting tired of superhero movies?"" on a marvel fanpage...A. MARVEL. FANPAGE. Needless to say it didn't go over well...

The thing is I have been getting super irritated super easily so when people disagreed with a, um, strong choice of words, I reacted...with a stronger choice of words.


I ended up getting in a really pointless and dumb argument before realizing how pointless and dumb it was and deleted the post.

What would be the best options from me to go forward in ridding myself of the delusions? I have an appointment with my psych this week and just want to be prepared going into the appointment.

I’m trying to work on my food. Food and I have never been friends. It hurts to eat, and I never know how much to eat. And I’ve been fighting bulimia. It’s terrible. I’d love to do intermittent fasting, my I can’t do that on Latuda. 

It looks like it might rain, so I don’t know if the bike ride I wanted to do is still in order.

Anyways I've had depression for at least 5 years now, was diagnosed as Borderline a couple years ago. I was put on Cipralex, made me terribly anxious. Then went on Pristiq which was awful to come off of. Now I'm on prozac and I can't sleep since I started taking it. I wake up in the middle of the night completely agitated. Then I eventually doze off and wake up again at like 5 am. I also started the process of coming off Latuda, an atypical antipsychotic mood stabilizer which I thought to be super helpful. My psych thinks I should go up on the prozac to help with anxiety and just take sleeping pills (which aren't working) and to come off the latuda completely. I was doing great mood wise for a while, but the last couple weeks I've been really sad and moody and today I just don't care about being alive anymore. Everyone in my family is congratulating me on coming off meds but I feel so low today maybe coming off meds was a mistake. ",anxious

8yaqim,"I was talking a few days ago about how Latuda might have been the best thing that ever happened to me, and now I'm suddenly less sure about that. In the last week or so it's felt like a chore to write creatively, and that's a big problem for me. Writing is how I escape even for a little bit, the way I get out of the world and into a better or just different one. Now it feels so much harder to get there, I haven't been able to even look at some of my old stuff without feeling angry that I can't seem to make things work now.

Part of that was a lack of my long acting ADHD meds, which give me the focus I need to actually put words on paper, but I had adderall and was still unable to write. I've heard that anti-psychotics can do this, but this is the first time I've experienced it and I feel like I'm now facing the classic dilemma: do I want to be miserable and able to write, or happy and devoid of creativity? Happy isn't even the right word, it's much closer to sane or stable, and that makes it less of a choice for me. I love being able to create. I tell stories, that's kind of my thing. I feel empty without the ability, hollow and devoid of a soul. 

Is this the Latuda, or am I just in a creative slump? It doesn't feel like that to me, but I don't know. Writing is the only thing that brings me a real sense of accomplishment or joy, I don't know what I'd be without it. I'd probably go back to smoking and I'm already struggling with that.

8y49dt,I recently got put on Latuda and everyday for the past 3 weeks I get hit with this giant lack of motivation and no will to do anything. I’ll sit down and try to do any activity and will just receive no joy or want to do it. It always happens at a particular time of day too... about 1-2 pm ish. The only way I’ve able to sort of break out of it is through running on a treadmill. Has this happened to anyone taking Latuda or similar anti psychotics? I thought it was helping me when I was delusional pretty well but it’s not worth it if it sucks the joy out of me... any thoughts? Is it weird that it’s not an all day thing? Thanks! ,anhedonia

8y2kmz,"First, I just want to say that it is so encouraging to read everyone’s posts on the sub and all the encouragement you give. 

Right now I’m in a state of being constantly depressed after a huge manic episode that made me have a psychotic break which landed me in a state hospital thinking I was being secretly trained to join the FBI until I woke up after four days of being hospitalized and realized that I was absolutely crazy ¯\_(?)_/¯. Luckily, things have been ok for me and I was blessed to get a full time job. Now, the main stressor is feeling like nothing is fun to do and feeling like I’m all alone. All of my friends have moved away to other cities. My previous relationship ended terribly because I was a terrible boyfriend. I used to be so happy and eccentric and now I just always feel bored and alone. I’m on Latuda to combat the depression right now. 

How do you all cope when you don’t have any friends or a partner to go to? How do you make yourself find hobbies or make yourself enjoy life? How do adults make friends anyway? The suicidal thoughts used to be just whispers but they slowly get louder and it’s scary. I’m just afraid this is going to be my whole life; coming home from work at 5 and wondering what I should do until I go back to work the next day. Weekends are THE WORST because I have nothing to do.

I just don’t want to be alone and bored and it feels good to get this out. Thanks for reading. If you have any advice, I’d be super thankful. Have a good day. ",suicidal thoughts

8zsmbg,"Good evening y’all,
I have been lurking for a little while, made a throwaway today. A little about me, was moderately successful at chipping for about 7 years, mostly oxy. The last 5 months got really out of hand. My wife has issues that = abundance of oxy and fent patches, for about 7 years now, was able to keep my habit to 2 or 3 a week, but had a breakdown a few months back, the ultimate result was sniffing about 7-9 blues a day, sucking on cut up strips off of fent patch, about 300 dollars in kratom a week (just for withdrawal when I was out), and anything else I could get my hands on. Filled her 150 pill script on May 19th, she confronted me, crying on May 26th that only had a few left, all my lies and excuses were completely exhausted, told her I would get help. Called around, found a dr that seemed really positive, was inducted on June 1st. I do read a lot of negative stuff on the sub about Suboxone, but for me, even if it is naivety, it has ABSOLUTELY changed my life for the better in the last month and a half. EVERYTHING has been great, and I feel normal again for the first time since I started doing drugs, in the early 90’s. 
I am on 20mg a day (2 1/2 8/2 pills a day, do have some nausea and dull headaches, but I take otc nausea meds to combat, it works for me)
Now, to the questions, is anybody in here currently on Suboxone and Strattera? I was just prescribed Strattera, and have read up on it a lot, but haven’t come across anybody that is on both yet. Let me know your experiences (I do understand MMV with everybody, but any info is appreciated). I was started on 80mg, took my first dose today, was very happy not to get the adverse side affects almost everybody complains about. If you are on both, can you please help me understand how/when you know it’s working, and as specific as possible how it affects your focus, mood, and emotions?
Much appreciated!!!
Next question; If any of you live in NY, and you are not aware yet, there was an emergency amendment to the medical marijuana program, where mm dr’s now HAVE to give the patients the option to request MM as opposed to opiates. This does cover OAD (Opiod Abuse Disorder), as outlined in the amendment. This is great news for advocates like myself, I was so excited that I called my dr right away, and he was also excited. He told me he would read it over and most likely enroll me on Friday (my next visit). The question I have is this, can my dr prescribe both Suboxone and MM? From the sounds of it, he has no problem with it at all, I only worry that he is fairly new to addiction treatment, and I don’t want to unknowingly get him in trouble. 
Thank you for reading, I love this sub, you have helped me a lot, and this sub is probably the only reason I decided to go this route instead of trying to go cold turkey, or even switching to herion.

8zl8qz,"Hello All,

I have a friend that was addicted to Percs for a while when she was in her teens/early 20s. She has been clean from them for about 5 years now and is taking Subutex and Suboxone (no scrip).

She needs to drop from taking them quickly and is worried about the withdraw.

That being said: The amount she takes daily is so ridiculously small. An 8mg subutex pill will last her over a month. She shaves off a small amount in the morning and that's it. I'm fairly certain that she is over-blowing the whole thing and since she is taking such a tiny amount daily that the withdrawal will be like a mild cold for about a week. Am i wrong in this? How bad will her withdraw symptoms be? Any advice is greatly appreciated.", withdrawal

8zczkn,"It's officially the longest time I went without kratom since I started using daily around 1.5 years ago, when I was trying  to quit before I was making it to day 5-6 and then I just gave up so 9 days doesn't sound as that big of a deal but it is for me, I'm very happy with my progress.

My last dose of suboxone was on Thursday around 2 pm. Friday and Saturday I supported myself with with around 50mg of tramadol a day and Sunday and today I switched over to loperamide. 

I gotta say that I was a lot more comfortable when I was on suboxone, ever since I stopped taking it I have constant but thankfully mild headache, RLS, some stomach discomfort and huge trouble with sleep. Tonight I only slept for maybe 3.5 hours tops, I couldn't fall asleep until midnight and I woke up before 4 am which sucks because Monday is one of my busiest days of the week (right after Tuesday...) but I'm hanging in there, I need to get more melatonin for tonight.

8zbt14,"Just a quick question, and I’ve searched for an answer to this question pretty extensively so any help would be very, very much appreciated:

**Would taking suboxone before withdrawal has set in send me into withdrawal if I’ve been using exclusively fentanyl, since bupe apparently has a lower binding affinity than fentanyl itself? I feel like I’ve gotten mixed reports on this.**

Also, what’s the best way to induce subs if this is the case? I’ve heard that doing a little bit of subs then a little bit of your DOC to alleviate precipitated withdrawal might work. 

Again, thank you so much for any help whatsoever, I’m just trying to get sober and **I really hope this post doesn’t get deleted since my main question is something I haven’t found specific answers/explanations that address it.**

Thanks! ",Withdrawal
8z7z5b,"This happened a couple years ago during my second year of college. Back then, I was going to a small community college and several of my friends went there as well. On our days that we had the same schedule, we would often grab food at some of the fast food places up the street, and on this day, we had chosen Wendy’s.

The place was relatively empty, but me and my two friends ordered and then sat down at a booth near some windows. We got our food and were about halfway through our meal when this shady man passed by us. He looked to be about in his late 20’s with a sweater on and super greasy black hair with a mustache.

The man passed by once, and then looked out one of the windows before turning to pass by our booth again. On his second pass, he stopped and turned to my friend Cameron, who was sitting directly across from me. He put his hand on Cameron’s shoulder and leaned down really close, very quickly so that none of us really had time to react. He asked Cameron in a hushed voice,

“Hey man, do you know where I can get any boxin?” None of us knew what he meant, and Cameron, visibly confused just stuttered out a “what?” and the man repeated “boxin. You know any man?” 

At this point, Cameron thought that the man was meaning to say “boxes”, and he told the guy

“I don’t know man, they might have some at the counter for you.” The guy nodded his head and immediately left the Wendy’s. We didn’t think anything of it, but someone sitting in the booth behind us stood up and asked

“Did that guy just ask you about boxin?” He went on to explain to us that “boxin” is a slang term for a drug called Suboxone, which is a highly addictive drug used to ween people off of harder substances, but it can be abused just as easily. A lady across from us overheard the conversation and mentioned that she had seen the guy walking around the parking lot a bit earlier and talking to people that were in their cars, probably asking them the same thing.

While it wasn’t the creepiest thing in the world, me and my friends were all pretty uncomfortable that some creep felt like it was okay to ask some random college kids just having lunch in a public place if they knew where to get a drug that none of us had even heard of, and I thought it was honestly kind of sad to see someone that desperate to get high. The guy that explained the drug to us actually did end up notifying the police of what had happened, but we never heard anything about the man after that day.

8z3hfq,"Yesterday was day 18 off of Suboxone. I had been using using high doses of kratom to curb the withdrawals (30-40 grams a day) but after a week I got so dehydrated I ended up in the ER. After that I quit taking it for a couple days and started feeling really off. Symptoms that seemed to be identical to when I quit taking Zoloft a while ago. Tightness in the chest, anxiety, headache, rocking motion with vertigo, nausea, looping thoughts, high heart rate. I started taking 10 grams a day and things got better but not a whole lot. After a while I figured it might just be lingering opiate withdrawals so I took 2mg of Suboxone last night and although some of the aches and restlessness got better the tightness in my chest, anxiety, and dizziness didn't. At first I thought these symptoms could have been from the calcium channel blocking properties of kratom which are similar to those of drugs like gabapentin or Lyrica, and since I'm tapering Valium it might have raised my tolerance to that. But anytime I take the Valium it does nothing to mitigate these symptoms. Anybody have experience with these symptoms and know if they're related to how kratom raises your serotonin?

That friend is currently overseas and my hooks number suddenly goes dead on me. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. Im already getting sick and i have no one to call. Fuck it, i have suboxone, ill just quit.

Withdrawals get worse and worse and worse, fuck this shit, i need to figure something out. So i search for roofing tar on CL and start texting people in my area ""in need of roofing materials.""

Now i have no criminal record and have a lot of responsibilities in my life, so i cant afford to get busted or get my ass whooped.

One dude replies. Asks me if im mobile. I reply and say that i am and that i would like to try before buying. He says okay and tells me to meet at a close by shopping center, like a 5 minute drive. 

Theres a starbucks in the shopping center, i say lets meet inside there, hand me a piece, ill smoke it in the bathroom, and if its legit, ill give you the cash and we can execute the transaction. He says ok.

So the positive signs are that 1) public place, 2) i get to try it first, 3) guy is italian. My gut tells me it looks good.

I go to the starbucks and im standing outside. The dude is running a little late, bad sign. I call him, he says hes parked far and that hes walking to me. I thought that was kind of odd. I describe what im wearing. So im standing there and crossing my fingers. 

Dude walks up, gives me the ""are you him?"" look/body language. I nod. Right off the bat, he looks really non threatening. Hes wearing shorts and a t shirt n slippers, so he cant possibly have a weapon. We walk to the back of the starbucks. He shoots me a piece from the bag hes about to sell me. I go in the bathroom. That piece makes me well. I have a little mini celebration in front of the bathroom mirror. You did it you fuckin junkie, good job. I exit the bathroom, swap cash for roofing material, and say thanks. Dude says to save his number n he says can get me virtually anything i need.

Good shit. So i got a new hook who so far has been very puntual. His shit is decent and the price okay, but he came thru when i was desperate. Crisis averted.

Sometimes I still harbor serious rage about it. I was there for him in any and every way I ever could have been to a completely unhealthy level of loyalty and to just go. Not even a word. That's something else, next level cold. And now I spend half my time wondering if it'll be over dose or suicide. Unfortunately I have always known barring a freak accident I'm going to loose Cobain to the grave long before I'm ready.

Cobain and I have a series of really screwed up stories. Ohh my first apartment!! 4 years ago today he completely disappeared without a word because he was completely spineless to his then gf. Sometimes I still harbor serious rage about it. I was there for him in any and every way I ever could have been to a completely unhealthy level of loyalty and to just go. Not even a word. That's something else, next level cold. And now I spend half my time wondering if it'll be over dose or suicide. Unfortunately I have always known barring a freak accident I'm going to loose Cobain to the grave long before I'm ready. 

Tomorrow I'm supposed to be seeing Jonny while his on again off again gf/bm is at work. (Keep in mind a PFA is in place and there living together ?) I will see how that goes and write tomorrow. Wish me luck lol. ",suicide
8yxyu4,"Along time ago I was a very successful chipper of Heroin.  I managed that well for a very long time by microdosing shots.  Doing it this way, I temporarily succeeded in getting away with having my cake and eating it for a very long time.  Staving off physical withdrawals during my off-periods was easily done by using Kratom.

Because of this routine, I fell into the Hubris trap thinking that I thwarted physical dependence, thinking I was being smarter than your average user.  And for the most part, I deluded myself into thinking that this was true.   You see, for most of my time using, There was no problem with consistently scoring close to pure quality grade Heroin.  

It all change at some point when I had to switch sources, resulting in getting Fentanyl cuts.  Yeah, you know where this goes...

At that point Kratom couldnt make any of my symptoms go away.  The two worst physical symptoms I feared the most was feeling physical asphyxiation - like something was sitting on top of my chest and the sharp acute pain inside my head - as if something was scraping the insides of my skull.  I was no longer able to sleep off the physical withdrawals, and at that point I was able to finally empathize with those who opened the pandora's box to reveal the real demons.  I knew I ended up with more than I bargained for.

At this point, I was desperate.  I tried almost all solutions I could find almost to no avail.  For a while, I tried suboxone and I was able to taper down to .25mg but even then I wasnt fooling no one let alone myself.  I still had cravings and I never felt normal it.  It seemed like I would forever be stuck forever in a perpetual loop of opiod craving and use.  
---------------------------------------------------------------


That is until a few months ago when I got on Methadone and man, what a world of difference it felt being in treatment with it.  I never knew what despair and hopelessness felt like until I felt trapped into a heroin/fentanyl addiction.

With Methadone on the other hand, I could finally see some glimmer of hope and take recovery, treatment and stability seriously.  

I took my time with slowly titrating to the dose that I am at now (100mg) and I am comfortable where I am at and Im not looking back.  I know I will probably have another year or two to go before I see progress but to no longer be enslaved by physical dependence is something I do not take for granted.

If there is anyone reading this who's on the fence with seeking treatment for their addiction, this message is especially for you guys.  It's a wise thing to weigh your options but don't fall into the herd mentality and not seek treatment due to Stigma.  

Being on Methadone saved my life and I have no regrets treating myself with it.  There truly is hope!

Thanks everyone who took the time to read this.  Wish you all well on your journey with recovery!

8yw0bv,"Hello everyone!  I just found this sub, and I’m glad I did.  I’ve been riding steady at 4 to 8 mg per day for over ten years!!  TEN YEARS!!  Suboxone saved my life, truly.  Ive built so much while on subs.  I’m really wanting to taper, but I’m mentally stuck.  I know there are ways to do it with little withdrawals, but the thought is still terrifying.  I really just wanted to say hi and hear about other people who’ve been on it for a long time like me.  I’m afraid that I’ve been on it too long to come off easily.",withdrawals
8yvyf1,"I’ve been addicted to anything opiate related since I was 17. Got a script for pain, back in the day they were really liberal with pain meds. By month 3 I was on 15mg percs 3x a day. And I kept taking them even when I wasn’t in pain anymore. Two years later I went to rehab, then sober living, felt amazing and was back to normal. 

Went to school to be a medic, things were going great, had a job I loved, great friends and nothing to complain about. Then I broke my arm training and started the cycle of addiction all over again.  Couldn’t function sick so I left my job I loved. A couple years later got on methadone. CT’D 150mg habit because hurricanes don’t give a fuck if you need methadone. I wanted to die. Got off the done, was normal again. 

Then someone offering me Vicodin to help with a broken rib turned into me chasing pain pills again. I should have just CT’d. But most addicts look for an easy way out. And suboxone docs don’t really give af, they’ll give anyone subs for a price. Basically I ended up with a legal dealer. Subs didn’t help, I turned into a zombie. All I wanted to do was eat subs and sleep. 

One day I woke up and didn’t like who I was. So I flushed my script, got some comfort meds and rode out the storm for 3 weeks. I was embracing the suck. Until someone “helpful” told me about kratom and how it takes away wds, is non addictive and is as easy as coffee to give up. I couldn’t drink that first tea fast enough. The relief was amazing. I loved life again. 

Well fast forward 6months and 30gpd later, the honeymoon was over. I was an empty shell of a human. Anxiety and depression wrecked me. Every.single.day.  I do what I know best and said “fuck it” found out this forum and jumped. 

It hasn’t been easy, but not impossible either. Day 17 and things are looking up. Getting my dream dog next week, work is busy which help makes the days go by. I take my supplements religiously in fear of paws anxiety or depression. But I felt so emotionally wrecked on kratom anything paws has in store has to be better than how I was living. This r/sub has helped me so much. I’m one of the people for the first week , I kept checking the thread to read stories that coincided with the day i was on. Im hopeful I’ve learned that nothing is worth the amount of pain I’ve put myself thru. And that opiates aren’t fun anymore, at this point it’s just sad.  I look forward to being healthy and normal, but also fear it. Because thats when I fuck up. Always. ",addicted

8yqk75,"My brother has been clean of heroin for over nine months, thanks in part to suboxone. He had it stolen yesterday and withdraw symptoms are starting. It's a good 10 hours before we can get him more. Any suggestions for helping him to deal with the withdraws? 

EDIT:
Thanks to all of you! I've been really moved by how supportive this subreddit is. My brother is doing better today. We were able to use some ancient sources to get just enough suboxone last night, so it's just going to be a daily struggle right now until we can refill the script.

On a personal note, I've dealt with addiction before (amphetamines are my drug), and as hard as quitting that was... I've never seen first hand what dealing with a heroin addiction looks like. I love my brother and I'm glad we have each other now, and I love you guys. Active users or not, addicts or not, you all deserve and are worthy of dignity. Thank you all! Keep fighting.",withdraws

I used kratom to get through the worst of it during the first two weeks, about 25-30 grams a day. This week I've drastically cut down on the kratom to more like 10 grams daily. The past couple days I've been getting horrible anxiety accompanied by a few other symptoms, and a tightness in my chest that won't go away. The left side of my face is super numb too. I should add I'm tapering off of Valium but holding my dose right now. I know the post acute phase can rough mentally but this feels a lot different than other times I've kicked opiates, and it almost feels like benzo withdrawal. Derealization, impaired thinking, paranoia, looping thoughts, tinnitus. Can stopping kratom cause this? I've heard from a few sources that it can act as a calcium channel blocker which is how gabapentin works, and would amp up your CNS and give you benzo type withdrawals. I've also heard that the serotonin effects can cause benzo like symptoms. ",withdrawals

8yoz12,"Today is day 17 off of Suboxone. Things are definitely mellowing out as far the withdrawals from that go which I couldn't be happier about. For the first 12 or 13 days I was taking pretty high doses of kratom to curb the withdrawals, about 25 to 30 grams a day. Then I started getting SEVERELY dehydrated from the diuretic effects of kratom and actually ended up in the ER and had to get a saline drip. It probably didn't help that it's been hot and I was already sweating my brains out from detoxing, but I also had a sinus infection. At that point I stopped taking the kratom because the Suboxone withdrawals were abating and because I didn't want to keep getting dehydrated. Then a couple days later I start having horrible anxiety and other symptoms similar to benzo withdrawal out of the blue; derealization, headaches, muscle aches, sensitivity to light and sound, tinnitus, left side of my face is numb.

8ylwyu,"I need advice. 

My husband was an IV heroin addicts for years (maybe 7? I’m not sure) he was on suboxone when we got together and he was on it for a total of 3 years. 

He got off the suboxone 16 months ago.

Since then he has talked about wanting to do opiates (Percocet, Vicodin, hydrocone etc). His friend offered him some today and he is planning on picking them up today after work. 

The only reason I know this is because I was working on the computer when the messages popped up from his Facebook account. 

Every other time I have pleaded and begged him not to because I am so worried about him relapsing and ruining our lives. He has been to prison as a by product of his addiction and went to rehab something like 8 times.

I cannot imagine him being in the throes of addiction because I cannot imagine him hurting the people that he loves. I love my husband so much. There is so much about addiction I do not understand. 

I have done lots of reading and research. 

In my opinion, he should not use opiates recreationally because it has the potential to be catastrophic for us. I would never put our family in the position to hurt us and I can’t understand why he is willing to take that risk. 

 I think he need to put US First and not his wants and needs. 

He says it will be fine because he is different now, and he isn’t as weak as I think he is. 

I think he shouldn’t be putting his recovery in jeopardy. He insists that he just wants to feel good. I insist that he needs different and better coping mechanisms.

I would go to the literal ends of the earth for my husband. Everything I do in life I do for us to have a better future. 

He says he hates that I won’t let him be himself by using opiates recreationally. I know his addiction is something that will have to be managed forever and I knew that coming into this marriage. 

He is acting so flippant about using again because “it will only be once in a while”. How can I get him to see that is is wrong and that he could ruin our relationship?

Does anyone have any advice for dealing with a spouse going through this?? It’s like I can’t reason with him and he thinks that he’s just cured of his addiction now so he can do it again. That because he’s had a steady life since we’ve been together that he’s better now. All those things have only happened because of his sobriety. How can I help him??? 

I’m so scared. 

I’m sorry if you think I am being dramatic but this is a big deal to me. 

EDIT:

Thank you for all the advice. He DID NOT go pick it up. 
We have a lot of work to do moving forward. I would ideally like to get both of us in therapy both separately and together. We are going through a stressful time right now as we are moving entirely across the state so that I can begin law school.  I think that fear of the unknown can be a big trigger.  I would also like to say that I would not have left him if he did go pick it up. However, if he chooses his addiction over me I do realize there will come a time when that choice would need to be made.

I took 2 melatonin pills and that didn't work, 3 ish hours after that melatonin I  gave up and took 0.5 mg of xanax and that did the trick. On Wednesday I tried tapering down to ~0.25-0.35 mg of suboxone (those pieces get so small that it's hard to cut them equally) and I was still sick so I ended up taking 0.5 mg total on that day. After redose I was ""fine"" physically but I got really depressed, that was actually the first time that I felt mentally bad and depressed since I stopped taking kratom. That depressed state made me crave any type of high, alcohol, kratom, weed whatever but I knew that it will only make it worse in the long run so I spent the entire afternoon at the shooting range, shooting is one of my favorite things to do and it helped, I got through the day without getting high or going back to kratom. Night was rough too but melatonin+tiredness made me fall asleep.

8yfv4h,"Got an 8mg subutex and have no experience with these, as I’ve always had suboxone.  Can someone please help me understand the difference?  My dboy said you could still get high while taking subutex (unlike suboxone which has the blocking effect), but I’ve seen that either will cause PWD. Therefore, I assume you need to wait until you are in WD before taking?  Also, after you take the tex can you use and get high?  My plan is to take 2mg of the tex in the morning and taper down over the next few days (that’s always how I do it with suboxone); however, I saved a few blues, and want to take them after work tomorrow. Will that work? Any input is appreciated? ",get high

I dont want to risk anything significant health wise as I want to take 1200mg plus or else it's not really worth it for me even after years of stopping it never really changed my tolerance at this point so please dont advise against a high dose after such a long period without using I am very well aware of how I react to dxm I just want to know about the suboxone interactions.

I have been using DXM for 15 years now on and off but pretty heavy at times (1200mg to 1800mg) couple times a week etc. I have not done it in a couple years at least not anything 3rd or above but I have tried pretty much every kind out there mostly just prefer the pure stuff have been lucky to have been able to find multiple sources over the years Alibaba being the most recent.

1st success after a few days, was back at work day 9. 

2nd no way- drove me to insanity and was dumb years ago and failed 12 days in. 

On my 3rd time 10 days in today.

10 years prescribed to me, first detox got in when it was very controlled like a few months, taper and no more. Very clinical and strict. Eventually it morphed into, you put big cash upwards of $300 and walk out with 6 months huge script. But its like anything else and I believe our responsibility to choose what we buy and put in our bodies. So withdrawl situations vary greatly, based on doctor, history and length on. 

So today, I slept about 4 1/2 hrs going on a week, of two sleep cycles with stomach pains upon waking up. My brain is still sorting it out, but my body just is run down from lack of real sleep. It's very mental but in a physical rebuilding way. Hurts my bones, but what I'm doing...

I'm just letting it be. I'm on medicinal cannabis a lot, it's the only way things feel ok without crying sometimes from how taxing this is, or just going to a bad place.

I have twelve 10 mg Methadone tablets my mom managed to score for me to complete this detox. 

I’m thinking I’ll probably do 3 tomorrow, 2 the next day, then 1.5, then 1 then stop. 

Does this sound appropriate? (I mean, I’ll have extra if I really need it, but I’m hoping this will do the trick.) 

Any tips would be great. 

My fiancé will be beside me doing a Suboxone taper. We tried Kratom (and we do still have some on hand) but it really just makes us sleepy. I had high hopes for it.

8xwd1j,"A little back story I have used Adderall/Ritalin in the past but it’s been a while and I don’t remember it being like this. 

I am on suboxone and I’ve been trying like hell to taper and now I have financial issue and basically I needed to get my dose down FAST but I have a demanding job managing a restaurant so it’s been really hard. 

I finally decided to acquire some Adderall to take for a few days and just immediately drop from 16 mg of sub to 4 mg. So I did that and the first day was rough, but I felt more than decent from the Adderall. I took 30mg. 

The next day I took 30 mg again and it didn’t really do too much. So the following day I took 45 mg figuring hey whatever I know amp tolerance builds pretty fast and still pretty much nothing. The next day I had off work and obv should have just not taken any, but I was too dumb to realize that and took 45 mg again to little effect. And finally yesterday I took 60 mg once again to little effect. 

I mean, I knew amp tolerance was fast.... but I didn’t think it was that fast?! Just seems crazy. I mean even heroin wasn’t that bad. 

Is there something I am missing or doing wrong? I take first thing in am on empty stomach hoping to feel it by the time I am at work but I seem to feel nothing. 

I was hoping to take it one last day, tomorrow, because I have to work and it’s a busy day, but is there a dose I can take that will be worthwhile without being insane? Or anything I can do to get more out of it? Or have I just adjusted to the medication and will no longer get a high regardless of dose until I take time off?

>6.3. Schizophrenia

>Schizophrenia is a severe and complex neuropsychiatric disorder that affects 1% of the population worldwide [192,193,194]. Symptoms of schizophrenia are described as “positive” (also so-called productive) and “negative” ones: the first include hallucinations, paranoia and delusions, while negative examples are: limited motivation, impaired speech, weakening and social withdrawal. These symptoms usually appear in early adulthood and often persist in about three-fourths of patients despite optimum treatment [192]. Some authors have suggested that insufficient dopamine level due to the loss of dopamine producing cells may lead to schizophrenia [195]. On the other hand, it has been postulated that schizophrenia has been linked to hyperactivity of brain dopaminergic systems that may reflect an underlying dysfunction of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission [194]. Furthermore, there is the increasing evidence that several physiological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, altered one carbon metabolism and atypical immune-mediated responses may be involved in schizophrenia pathomechanism [192,196].

>Hoffer [197] summarized in the review study the evidence showing that among others Vit C deficiency could worsen the symptoms of schizophrenia and that large doses of this vitamin could improve the core metabolic abnormalities predisposing some people to development of this disease. According to the author, it is probable that the pathologic process responsible for schizophrenia could increase ascorbic acid utilization. Sarandol et al. [198] also noted lower levels of serum Vit C as compared to control group, but this was not regarded as a statistically significant difference. Moreover, a 6-week-long antipsychotic treatment did not modify the concentration of this vitamin. The authors explained that other factors, such as nutrition, physical activity, etc., might be the reason for the discrepancy between the results of their research and other studies. Similarly, Young et al. [199] observed only a slight decrease in Vit C levels in schizophrenic group vs. control one; but interestingly, a highly significant increase in Vit C level in the control female group as compared to both control as well as schizophrenic male group was observed. The authors pointed out that this information might be relevant particularly in the light of recent reports that the risk of schizophrenia is higher in men than women. The reduced supply of Vit C with the diet in patients with schizophrenia was noted by Konarzewska et al. [200].

>The review of Magalhães et al. revealed that the implementation of Vit C as a low-molecular-weight antioxidant alleviated the effects of free radicals in the treatment of schizophrenia [201]. According to Bentsen et al. [202] membrane lipid metabolism and redox regulation may be disturbed in schizophrenia. These authors conducted a study aiming at examination of the clinical effect of adding vitamins E + C to antipsychotics (D2 receptor antagonists). Patients with schizophrenia or related psychoses received Vit C (1000 mg/day) along with vitamin E (364 mg/day) for 16 weeks. Vitamins impaired the course of psychotic symptoms, especially of persecutory delusions. The authors pointed to the usefulness of supplementation of antioxidant vitamins as agents alleviating some side effects of antipsychotic drugs. This was also confirmed by the next study involving schizophrenia patients treated with haloperidol [203]. Classical antipsychotics like haloperidol are suggested to increase oxidative stress and oxidative cell injury in brain, which may influence the course as well as treatment effects of schizophrenia. In this study, chronic haloperidol treatment connected with supplementation of a combination of ?-3 fatty acids and vitamins E and C showed a significant beneficial effect on schizophrenia treatment as measured by SANS (Simpson Angus Scale) and BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) scales. BPRS total score and subscale scores as well as SANS scores were significantly improved starting from the 4th week of treatment. Moreover, in patients with schizophrenia after 16 weeks of treatment, serum Vit C levels were almost twice as high as at the beginning of the study. These results supported the hypothesis of a beneficial effect of the applied supplementation both on positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as well as the severity of side effects induced by haloperidol [203]. Heiser et al. [204] also stated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Their research demonstrated that antipsychotics induced ROS formation in the whole blood of rats, which could be reduced by the application of vitamin C. The aim of their study was to demonstrate the effects of clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol at different doses (18, 90 and 180 µg/mL) on the formation of ROS in the whole blood by using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. To demonstrate the protective capacity of Vit C the blood samples were incubated the highest concentration of each drug with Vit C (1 mM) for 30 min. Olanzapine caused significantly greater ROS formation vs. control under all treatment conditions, while in the case of haloperidol and clozapine only two higher concentrations resulted in significantly increased ROS formation. Vitamin C reduced the ROS production of all tested drugs, but for olanzapine the attenuating effect did not reach a significant level.

>A relatively novel approach as for the role of Vit C in etiology and treatment of schizophrenia was presented by Sershen et al. [193]. According to the researchers, deficits in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function are linked to persistent negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the flavoprotein D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) was shown to degrade the gliotransmitter D-Ser, a potent activator of N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors, while a lot of evidence has suggested that DAO, together with its activator, G72 protein, may play a key role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Furthermore, in a postmortem study the activity of DAO was found to be two-fold higher in schizophrenia subjects [205]. Sershen et al. [193] showed that acute ascorbic acid dose (300 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited PCP-induced and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity in mouse model, which was further attenuated in the presence of D-serine (600 mg/kg). The authors suggested that this effect could result from the Vit C-depended changes in dopamine carrier-membrane translocation and/or altered redox mechanisms that modulate NMDARs. However, this issue needs to be further investigated.

8yhn8y,"Hi guys I'm bipolar type I and I was wondering if Is there any hope? Can things become enjoyable again, even the small things like playing games or hanging out with friends?   


I remember when I was a kid up to my early 20's I always had things to look forward to, even though from an objective stand point my life was nowhere near as good as it is now. I'm a high achiever now, almost finished my bachelors and I've networked with a great bunch of people.  


In the past I wasn't really going anywhere, I just played video games all the time, they were fun. I'd kill to have a day like that where I could just sit and play a game and really enjoy it and look forward to playing it or something. I have co-morbid ADHD and have noticed that Ritalin drags me out of this numbness but only temporarily.  


Otherwise I don't get any pleasure out of anything, everything feels like a waste of time except my studies, even though that keeps me occupied I wouldn't call it 'fun'.   


I want to be able to feel like life is worth living, right now I don't really care, if someone said to me you're going to die tomorrow I'd just feel bad for my family rather than my own death.

I started  the Lamotrigine this morning at a super low dose of 5mg, took that this morning, nothing seems much different as expected till we work to a higher dose.  


I have been hitting my more elevated state the last few days though and definitely today have the normal signs that I can pick up on that I'm feeling a little too good so I took some Quetiapine (25mg) to try and calm that down, that was maybe three hours ago and I feel like I have had three coffees.  


I figure the Lamotrigine is too low to be having this effect and I didn't have this level of energy and racing thoughts till after the Quetiapine, anyone else experienced anything similar? I'm mainly confused cause I understand Quetiapine is supposed to have a sedating effect and usually I'm super sensitive to those and will just conk right out with an hour :/

8zdb0e,"I was talking 30mg paxil for just over 2 months without feeling any positive changes. The most dominant side effect that I had was I always tired. Considering my depression keeps me in bed for extended periods of time paxil definitely made it worse. I would need to have a nap immediately after work, go to bed early, and could barely wake up enough to drive safely.

I had taken trintillex before trying paxil and it was an eye opener. I felt so different. I had energy and was generally happier. But it made me so sick. It would come up almost immediately after I took it. I would lay there and fight it, but the nausea always won in the end. I started talking half of my dose in the morning and the other at night and it helped for a brief period. It became so bad that the thought of taking any pill would make me feel nauseated. I also take lamotrigine and was finding it near impossible to take.

So, now I'm coming off of paxil and suffering some terrible withdrawal symptoms. I sweat like crazy and generally feel like I'm running hotter than normal. My dreams are increasingly odd and wake up in cold sweats. Brain zaps... Omg... Anytime I move my eyes, or head. They're so bad I'm nervous to drive, which is a huge part of my job. I have diarrhea and I work out of my truck so I don't have a bathroom readily available which makes that symptom 100% worse. I can't stop crying. I have coworkers and customers to deal with and i start crying even worse because i feel so stupid i can't face anyone. I'm extremely irritable about the weirdest things. I feel like I've been reading situations incorrectly too. I've felt intimidated, scared, and like i was in danger by others conversations thinking a fight is about to happen. Which doesn't make sense when i think back on the situation and where literally no harsh words were exchanged. I just feel like a wreck...

I went home sick today and have used more sick days then i have available. I can't see my dr for another 2 days, but I've requested for my company's health program to get in touch with me. I've never taken a sick leave before and although i feel like i need some time off for these symptoms to disappear i don't know if these reasons are enough.

I feel like these symptoms are all in my head and I'm feeling guilty for wanting to take time off. :(

8zdb0e,"I was talking 30mg paxil for just over 2 months without feeling any positive changes. The most dominant side effect that I had was I always tired. Considering my depression keeps me in bed for extended periods of time paxil definitely made it worse. I would need to have a nap immediately after work, go to bed early, and could barely wake up enough to drive safely.

I had taken trintillex before trying paxil and it was an eye opener. I felt so different. I had energy and was generally happier. But it made me so sick. It would come up almost immediately after I took it. I would lay there and fight it, but the nausea always won in the end. I started talking half of my dose in the morning and the other at night and it helped for a brief period. It became so bad that the thought of taking any pill would make me feel nauseated. I also take lamotrigine and was finding it near impossible to take.

So, now I'm coming off of paxil and suffering some terrible withdrawal symptoms. I sweat like crazy and generally feel like I'm running hotter than normal. My dreams are increasingly odd and wake up in cold sweats. Brain zaps... Omg... Anytime I move my eyes, or head. They're so bad I'm nervous to drive, which is a huge part of my job. I have diarrhea and I work out of my truck so I don't have a bathroom readily available which makes that symptom 100% worse. I can't stop crying. I have coworkers and customers to deal with and i start crying even worse because i feel so stupid i can't face anyone. I'm extremely irritable about the weirdest things. I feel like I've been reading situations incorrectly too. I've felt intimidated, scared, and like i was in danger by others conversations thinking a fight is about to happen. Which doesn't make sense when i think back on the situation and where literally no harsh words were exchanged. I just feel like a wreck...

I went home sick today and have used more sick days then i have available. I can't see my dr for another 2 days, but I've requested for my company's health program to get in touch with me. I've never taken a sick leave before and although i feel like i need some time off for these symptoms to disappear i don't know if these reasons are enough.

I feel like these symptoms are all in my head and I'm feeling guilty for wanting to take time off. :(

8yw9dr,"5'5 195 lb 24 year old male. No physical illness other than high blood pressure, which I had until recently (lost 60 lbs). Am bipolar, obsessive compulsive, and have generalized anxiety. I take Abilify, Lamotrigine, and Klonopin each morning. I quit smoking cigarettes during this episode, but had been smoking around 8 a day. I do use marijuana frequently, as well.

I woke up on the Fourth of July (ten days ago) with what I thought was a hangover: room spinning, funny groggy feeling, eyes not quite focusing right at a diatance. I stumbled out of bed and realized that my walking wasn't entirely straight or steady. I was nauseated the first three or four days and did vomit on two days.

The nausea was seemingly caused by the room spinning sensation, which only came when I bent over or tilted my head a certain way. That symptom has lessened with time; I don't experience the spinning much at all these days.

On the third day my mother convinced me to go to the ER. She took me, as I did not feel comfortable driving.

I received fluids, got some bloodwork, and did a brief exam before being sent home with the assurance that this was temporary, and to follow up with my primary care practitioner. Doctor explained that MRIs and CT scans are very ""low yield"" considering my symptoms and age.

Two days later I saw my nurse practitioner, who insisted I either follow up with a neurologist or go to a different ER. She suggested that my medications could be causing this, which seemed unlikely to me because I have been on this cocktail for months with no problems.

Regardless, I call my psychiatrist's office. He advises me to cut my Lamotrigine dose in half and to see my primary care practitioner.

I have been using marijuana and, more recently, CBD oil, to reduce my general sense of discomfort, as well as... meclazine? But that doesn't seem to help so much since the nausea is gone.

I see a neurologist in three days and am extremely nervous. Would love some input, even if it's just to tell me what to expect when I see the neurologist.",dizzy

8yt1e0,"Hi,  I've been away for a while, taking break from amphetamine. But now I am  back and I decided to make this quite long post and I hope some of you  will be nice and spend some time reading it. Please don't take this post  as bragging or whining or whatever, I wrote it like this to convey my  situation accurately.

**Some facts about me:**

I  am 80kg (175 pounds), 27 years old male. I live upstairs in my quite  big house, which I share with my mother who lives downstairs (Yes, I do  live with my mom, it's not relevant to this post, I like it, I pay money  for it (half of bills and food), I can afford to move out, but I don't  want to and neither she wants me to leave. I am not in a serious  relationship with a girl who I could make plans with and I am not  thinking about having family right now, I also have excellent relations  with my mother).

I make a living by  managing my extended family assets, so I have too much free time and  quite a lot of money from it. You could say I am a privileged white kid.  I could afford almost every drug or polydrug habit, maybe good cocaine  could make strain on my finances if used daily. Drugs in Poland aren't  that expensive, well, except cocaine ;)

I  suffer from moderate back pain, as well as persistent depressive  disorder (also known as dysthymia, difficult disorder to treat with  medications), anhedonia and mild social anxiety, and I also probably  have IBS, which is mainly triggered by stress - two doctors and a nurse  (my aunt) made this diagnosis, but refereed me for further tests, which I  didn't take (they wanted to put finger in my ass, fuck them :P). I  could find myself some girlfriends, but being in lowered mood all the  time prevents me from keeping them for a longer time (more than few  months, that also doesn't make me very happy since I've met few  wonderful girls, but our ways parted...). Also, unfortunately, my  anhedonia keeps my libido on quite low levels and I don't find sex *that much* enjoyable. (I still remember the times before my malaise and I know how sex should feel like for a healthy person).

Since  I have all second floor for me, I can often organize parties and have  girls over. My mother doesn't mind, and since she works as a management  consultant, she's away on business trips most of the time.

Last thing, *all of my drugs are pharma grade or high quality, lab tested products.*

**Me and the drugs, the beginning:**

In one sentence: I always could more.

My  journey with drugs began long, long time ago with cigarettes (13 years  old), when my friends smoked 5 a day, I smoked 40. I gave it up after  ten years with absolutely no problems, but meanwhile I started drinking  booze. My usual night out included drinking between 0,7 - 1,2 liter  vodka or whisky (40&#37;), which made me super drunk but able to walk and  communicate on a basic level. Most of my friends could drink 0,5 - 0,7  vodka, which caused them to be barely conscious.

In  a meantime I tried various SSRI, SNRI, NDRI and other antidepressant  type drugs, even some neuroleptics, those were pills my old shrinks gave  me. All to no avail. All these pills gave me was some quite nasty side  effects (worst were tremors after Abilify) or no effect at all.

Then  I tried Xanax. 2mg put me in quite nice, warm state, but nothing  special. I called my neighbor and we both took 8mg each. My neighbor  showed remarkable tolerance, and we spent 3 hours strolling through our  city, visiting parks and having quite a good time. We were relaxed, had  honest conversations and felt appreciation for nature and it was very  nice. I remembered everything, though memories were a bit foggy  sometimes, (my neighbor blacked out and couldn't recall next day most of  this stroll, except that we took pills) and I found this experience  quite pleasurable (but it was fucking 8mg Pfizer Xanax for someone with  no tolerance!). Other than that, I still use Xanax in therapeutic doses  when I go to an anxiety inducing places, like tax office, city hall, tax  advisor or a date.

I also took Tramadol  for my back pain. 300mg didn't alleviate pain at all, and I will be  getting better narcotics in the future, but that's not important. 300mg  is a bit high dose for opioid naive person. It was quite nice for me, it  made me a bit chatty and gave me some slightly happy feeling, I haven't  felt for months. On the other hand it made me quite sleepy, but nothing  I couldn't overcome. It was actually a bit nice and from time to time I took more Tramadols to feel happy.

Around  this time amphetamine came into picture. I bought amphetamine (racemic)  directly from manufacturer and even then I used my old friend, who is a  PhD candidate taking care of University of Technology lab, to check my  stuff for purity. He told me that, apart from some minor impurities,  which are probably effect of clandestine method of production, the stuff  is pure. Acetone wash also didn't remove anything from stuff I got from  my dealer. On a side note, my dealer is extremely honest and punctual  guy, who has never fucked me. First time I took amphetamine (60mg), I  felt some pleasant feelings, I was definitely speedy, talking fast and  being more sociable. I did it for few weeks and then stopped, as  positive effects started to fade. Then I started doing it again starting  from 60mg, and was speeding for few months, adding more and more  amphetamine to each dose, which made my tolerance go through the roof.  I've also seen plenty people who took amphetamine for first time, or  after long break and they couldn't sit in one place, behaved as if they  had jet engine in their asses and couldn't stop talking. I've never  experienced such feelings and it's not a problem for me to sit still for  hours on amphetamine.

I smoked some  weed, but this drug, surprisingly, made me very sleepy and feeling heavy  and actually quite tired, anxious and plain bad. I don't like it and I  smoke it extremely rarely, which is always a bad experience (but  sometimes friends are *too*  persuasive...). I don't really like cocaine, as it makes me really  anxious and my heart is pounding after it. I tried it few times, and  every time I felt really bad. Maybe I didn't try a good coke or maybe  coke isn't just for me. Ambien also works wonders for me and few pill  allow me to spend some quality time with Walrus, which is kind of fun,  but since I live with my mother I don't want to scare her (And I did it  before, check my post history if you want) and I don't want to do it  alone, since you can easily do dangerous things on Ambien.

I also did plenty of other drugs, but it was once or twice and I don't feel mentioning it would add anything to this post.

**Drugs and me right now:**

I  haven't been drinking that much this year, compared to what I used to  drink before, just moderate amounts perhaps twice a month at most and  last time I got really wasted was on New Year's Eve. I've been taking  Tramadol every few weeks, so my tolerance is non-existent or minimal. I  took Xanax and Ambien heavily in May and June, but stopped because of  stupid shit I did under their influence and now I take them only  occasionally, perhaps once a week. I've also been trying to lower my  amphetamine tolerance, that was sky high (hundreds of mg per day) and  I've been clean from amphetamine for around 10 days.

**What happened this night:**

I  invited my girlfriend and two other friends for a few drinks and  PlayStation games. They were at my place from 9 pm to 1 am. I will just  write my drugs schedule. Note: All the drugs were taken orally,  amphetamine was encapsulated and weighed on milligram scale, 75 ml  whisky was poured to glass and Pepsi and ice was added afterwards (I  don't like coke, both soft drink and the drug :P). Time is, of course,  approximate, since I didn't measure it to make scientific research, I  just had a small social meeting, but I was having another glass about  every hour.

8pm - Lamotrigine (Anticonvulsant).

9pm - 150mg Tramadol, 200mg Amphetamine, 75ml Whisky.

10pm - 150mg Tramadol, 200mg Amphetamine, 75ml Whisky.

11pm-  200mg Amphetamine, 75ml Whisky.

12pm - 2mg Xanax, 75ml Whisky.

At 1am my friends went home, I took a bicycle and accompanied them on their way.

The  problem is, all this time I actually felt nothing from those drugs.  Booze didn't give me a buzz, Tramadol didn't give me this funny feeling,  Xanax didn't relax me. The only thing I felt was wakefulness from  amphetamine.

I went and talked with my  mother about it (she knows I do drugs) and she told me to avoid such a  dangerous mix (obviously) and tell my psychiatrist (whom I also told  about my drug abuse) about my inability to get happy even with help of  drugs in horse doses. Side note: he keeps me on Lamotrigine right now,  as a mood stabilizer, which also happens to be anticonvulsant, which is  good, since both amphetamine and Tramadol lower your seizure threshold.

**What is my problem?**

I  am not really into booze right now, so I don't care about it. But the  problem is, that I need higher doses than other people to enjoy  Xanax/Ambien, Tramadol or even this stupid booze. I don't know why is  that, maybe I lack some enzymes that metabolize drugs? I am just  guessing. The thing is, I always needed more, that most folks and  effects I experienced after taking drugs were subjectively milder than  these of my friends.

I also really like  amphetamine. But even now, after 10 days break, my tolerance is sky  high, and amphetamine doesn't produce any psychological effects apart  from wakefulness. I tried few weeks before to take more amphetamine and  after reaching 1 gram (five 200mg pills every 30min) I started to shake,  so I stopped at this point and took Xanax to calm me down. Yet no  psychological effects were present even then except from wakefulness.

I  don't know, maybe I should make even longer tolerance break, perhaps it  is connected with my aforementioned mental issues, maybe I should see  my psychiatrist and discuss it with him, or maybe I should try some  different drugs? I just wanna feel happy, even for short period of time,  I don't care if it's chemically induced. What's your opinion about it?", tremors

I remembered everything, though memories were a bit foggy  sometimes, (my neighbor blacked out and couldn't recall next day most of  this stroll, except that we took pills) and I found this experience  quite pleasurable (but it was fucking 8mg Pfizer Xanax for someone with  no tolerance!). Other than that, I still use Xanax in therapeutic doses  when I go to an anxiety inducing places, like tax office, city hall, tax  advisor or a date.

I also took Tramadol  for my back pain. 300mg didn't alleviate pain at all, and I will be  getting better narcotics in the future, but that's not important. 300mg  is a bit high dose for opioid naive person. It was quite nice for me, it  made me a bit chatty and gave me some slightly happy feeling, I haven't  felt for months. On the other hand it made me quite sleepy, but nothing  I couldn't overcome. It was actually a bit nice and from time to time I took more Tramadols to feel happy.

Around  this time amphetamine came into picture. I bought amphetamine (racemic)  directly from manufacturer and even then I used my old friend, who is a  PhD candidate taking care of University of Technology lab, to check my  stuff for purity. He told me that, apart from some minor impurities,  which are probably effect of clandestine method of production, the stuff  is pure. Acetone wash also didn't remove anything from stuff I got from  my dealer. On a side note, my dealer is extremely honest and punctual  guy, who has never fucked me. First time I took amphetamine (60mg), I  felt some pleasant feelings, I was definitely speedy, talking fast and  being more sociable. I did it for few weeks and then stopped, as  positive effects started to fade. Then I started doing it again starting  from 60mg, and was speeding for few months, adding more and more  amphetamine to each dose, which made my tolerance go through the roof.  I've also seen plenty people who took amphetamine for first time, or  after long break and they couldn't sit in one place, behaved as if they  had jet engine in their asses and couldn't stop talking. I've never  experienced such feelings and it's not a problem for me to sit still for  hours on amphetamine.

I smoked some  weed, but this drug, surprisingly, made me very sleepy and feeling heavy  and actually quite tired, anxious and plain bad. I don't like it and I  smoke it extremely rarely, which is always a bad experience (but  sometimes friends are *too*  persuasive...). I don't really like cocaine, as it makes me really  anxious and my heart is pounding after it. I tried it few times, and  every time I felt really bad. Maybe I didn't try a good coke or maybe  coke isn't just for me. Ambien also works wonders for me and few pill  allow me to spend some quality time with Walrus, which is kind of fun,  but since I live with my mother I don't want to scare her (And I did it  before, check my post history if you want) and I don't want to do it  alone, since you can easily do dangerous things on Ambien.

I also did plenty of other drugs, but it was once or twice and I don't feel mentioning it would add anything to this post.

**Drugs and me right now:**

I  haven't been drinking that much this year, compared to what I used to  drink before, just moderate amounts perhaps twice a month at most and  last time I got really wasted was on New Year's Eve. I've been taking  Tramadol every few weeks, so my tolerance is non-existent or minimal. I  took Xanax and Ambien heavily in May and June, but stopped because of  stupid shit I did under their influence and now I take them only  occasionally, perhaps once a week. I've also been trying to lower my  amphetamine tolerance, that was sky high (hundreds of mg per day) and  I've been clean from amphetamine for around 10 days.

**What happened this night:**

I  invited my girlfriend and two other friends for a few drinks and  PlayStation games. They were at my place from 9 pm to 1 am. I will just  write my drugs schedule. Note: All the drugs were taken orally,  amphetamine was encapsulated and weighed on milligram scale, 75 ml  whisky was poured to glass and Pepsi and ice was added afterwards (I  don't like coke, both soft drink and the drug :P). Time is, of course,  approximate, since I didn't measure it to make scientific research, I  just had a small social meeting, but I was having another glass about  every hour.

8pm - Lamotrigine (Anticonvulsant).

9pm - 150mg Tramadol, 200mg Amphetamine, 75ml Whisky.

10pm - 150mg Tramadol, 200mg Amphetamine, 75ml Whisky.

11pm-  200mg Amphetamine, 75ml Whisky.

12pm - 2mg Xanax, 75ml Whisky.

At 1am my friends went home, I took a bicycle and accompanied them on their way.

The  problem is, all this time I actually felt nothing from those drugs.  Booze didn't give me a buzz, Tramadol didn't give me this funny feeling,  Xanax didn't relax me. The only thing I felt was wakefulness from  amphetamine.

I went and talked with my  mother about it (she knows I do drugs) and she told me to avoid such a  dangerous mix (obviously) and tell my psychiatrist (whom I also told  about my drug abuse) about my inability to get happy even with help of  drugs in horse doses. Side note: he keeps me on Lamotrigine right now,  as a mood stabilizer, which also happens to be anticonvulsant, which is  good, since both amphetamine and Tramadol lower your seizure threshold.

**What is my problem?**

I  am not really into booze right now, so I don't care about it. But the  problem is, that I need higher doses than other people to enjoy  Xanax/Ambien, Tramadol or even this stupid booze. I don't know why is  that, maybe I lack some enzymes that metabolize drugs? I am just  guessing. The thing is, I always needed more, that most folks and  effects I experienced after taking drugs were subjectively milder than  these of my friends.

I also really like  amphetamine. But even now, after 10 days break, my tolerance is sky  high, and amphetamine doesn't produce any psychological effects apart  from wakefulness. I tried few weeks before to take more amphetamine and  after reaching 1 gram (five 200mg pills every 30min) I started to shake,  so I stopped at this point and took Xanax to calm me down. Yet no  psychological effects were present even then except from wakefulness.

I  don't know, maybe I should make even longer tolerance break, perhaps it  is connected with my aforementioned mental issues, maybe I should see  my psychiatrist and discuss it with him, or maybe I should try some  different drugs? I just wanna feel happy, even for short period of time,  I don't care if it's chemically induced. What's your opinion about it?",sleepy
8yt1e0,"Hi,  I've been away for a while, taking break from amphetamine. But now I am  back and I decided to make this quite long post and I hope some of you  will be nice and spend some time reading it. Please don't take this post  as bragging or whining or whatever, I wrote it like this to convey my  situation accurately.

**Some facts about me:**

I  am 80kg (175 pounds), 27 years old male. I live upstairs in my quite  big house, which I share with my mother who lives downstairs (Yes, I do  live with my mom, it's not relevant to this post, I like it, I pay money  for it (half of bills and food), I can afford to move out, but I don't  want to and neither she wants me to leave. I am not in a serious  relationship with a girl who I could make plans with and I am not  thinking about having family right now, I also have excellent relations  with my mother).

I make a living by  managing my extended family assets, so I have too much free time and  quite a lot of money from it. You could say I am a privileged white kid.  I could afford almost every drug or polydrug habit, maybe good cocaine  could make strain on my finances if used daily. Drugs in Poland aren't  that expensive, well, except cocaine ;)

I  suffer from moderate back pain, as well as persistent depressive  disorder (also known as dysthymia, difficult disorder to treat with  medications), anhedonia and mild social anxiety, and I also probably  have IBS, which is mainly triggered by stress - two doctors and a nurse  (my aunt) made this diagnosis, but refereed me for further tests, which I  didn't take (they wanted to put finger in my ass, fuck them :P). I  could find myself some girlfriends, but being in lowered mood all the  time prevents me from keeping them for a longer time (more than few  months, that also doesn't make me very happy since I've met few  wonderful girls, but our ways parted...). Also, unfortunately, my  anhedonia keeps my libido on quite low levels and I don't find sex *that much* enjoyable. (I still remember the times before my malaise and I know how sex should feel like for a healthy person).

Since  I have all second floor for me, I can often organize parties and have  girls over. My mother doesn't mind, and since she works as a management  consultant, she's away on business trips most of the time.

Last thing, *all of my drugs are pharma grade or high quality, lab tested products.*

**Me and the drugs, the beginning:**

In one sentence: I always could more.

My  journey with drugs began long, long time ago with cigarettes (13 years  old), when my friends smoked 5 a day, I smoked 40. I gave it up after  ten years with absolutely no problems, but meanwhile I started drinking  booze. My usual night out included drinking between 0,7 - 1,2 liter  vodka or whisky (40&#37;), which made me super drunk but able to walk and  communicate on a basic level. Most of my friends could drink 0,5 - 0,7  vodka, which caused them to be barely conscious.

In  a meantime I tried various SSRI, SNRI, NDRI and other antidepressant  type drugs, even some neuroleptics, those were pills my old shrinks gave  me. All to no avail. All these pills gave me was some quite nasty side  effects (worst were tremors after Abilify) or no effect at all.

Then  I tried Xanax. 2mg put me in quite nice, warm state, but nothing  special. I called my neighbor and we both took 8mg each. My neighbor  showed remarkable tolerance, and we spent 3 hours strolling through our  city, visiting parks and having quite a good time. We were relaxed, had  honest conversations and felt appreciation for nature and it was very  nice. I remembered everything, though memories were a bit foggy  sometimes, (my neighbor blacked out and couldn't recall next day most of  this stroll, except that we took pills) and I found this experience  quite pleasurable (but it was fucking 8mg Pfizer Xanax for someone with  no tolerance!).

8yj4rg,"4 days ago I had a review appointment with my psychiatrist. When I first saw him I was severely depressed and suicidal, this time I was hypomanic. He told me I seemed like a different person, and honestly I did feel like a different person. 

So he took me off my SSRIs and started me on lamotrigine because my hypomania wasn't exactly healthy. Things were going amazing and I was still hypomanic until today. I barely slept last night I was so productive, and then today I steeply crashed from a 10/10 mood to a 1/10 mood. By 5pm I was crying and left class to go home feeling incredibly suicidal. I fortunately managed to calm down using my safety plan that I had written, but I still feel so dead. 

I don't know if this is from the medication change or if this is just bipolar, but either way this is so shit. I'm so exhausted with these mood swings. My friends are exhausted with my mood swings. I'm so scared for the future, scared that lamotrigine won't work and I'll feel like this forever. I'm scared that next year when I start working in a hospital that I'll have a hypomanic episode and start laughing hysterically around patients when it is not appropriate to do so. I'm scared this will get me reported or even fired. Most of all, I'm scared that because I'm only 21, my condition will worsen.

I really wish things would be okay. I wish there was a magic pill that could make me better, but I know this is silly. I guess I just feel quite alone in my feelings and struggles and would love some virtual hugs.",crashed

I'm so scared for the future, scared that lamotrigine won't work and I'll feel like this forever. I'm scared that next year when I start working in a hospital that I'll have a hypomanic episode and start laughing hysterically around patients when it is not appropriate to do so. I'm scared this will get me reported or even fired. Most of all, I'm scared that because I'm only 21, my condition will worsen.

I really wish things would be okay. I wish there was a magic pill that could make me better, but I know this is silly. I guess I just feel quite alone in my feelings and struggles and would love some virtual hugs.",hypomanic episode

8y60qp,"I’m new here. I didn’t think I’d ever post but I’m upset and have no one else to talk to. 

I’ve always been pretty independent due to a rough childhood but the last few years have fucked. me. up. I now live with my boyfriend’s family, after having a kid (after only being together 1.5 months) I feel like a damn statistic. I support my family of three on my $10 an hour job while he does school full-time for his engineering degree. 

Anyway, I’m so down in the dumps that I’ve binged, every single day. I’m a fairly small frame. A healthy weight range for me is 115-120. (5’1” so any additional weight makes me look 2x as big since it has no were to go but out) I’m almost 155 now and I feel like I just can’t stop myself from becoming the train wreck that I feel I am. 

I’ve been depressed and untreated since childhood (and have made so many bad choices from it) but luckily an old family friend ha stepped up and offered to foot my $200 a month bill to see a psych. Right now I’m on 50 mg lamotrigine but it’s not helping. I’ve already been through Prozac and Zoloft. Nothing is helping. I’m even on 80mg Vyvance for ADHD and STILL binging daily to the point of pain, and shame. 

Without trying to sound dramatic I honestly feel like I’ll never be happy and it scares the shit out of me. How do you guys talk yourselves down from the ledge? I’m lost. I need help.  ",binging
8y5xon,"Hi all, I was recently diagnosed with deja vu seizure disorder. I'm on a titration schedule for Lamotrigine and only at 50mg so far. I think such a low dosage shouldn't have any side effects, but maybe it could? Has anyone here experienced confusion as a side effect of Lamotrigine?

I'm increasingly struggling to know whether a particularly strong memory is something that really happened, or if it's a kind of hallucination. The more I try to think about the memories in question, the more they slip away. It happens at least once a day and I feel like I'm going crazy. ",confusion

8zfq0p,"Ok I know I am not a normal Reddit user. I don't know how to reddit. I already posted in here twice about my plan to taper. Then I recently posted about quitting cold turkey and on that day I was more scared than I have been in a long time. I was rebounding off phenibut every 5 hours so for the last two months of my use I was unbearably anxious and miserable. Insomnia all the time. The last week of my using I went up 8 grams. 6 grams just wasn't doing the trick anymore. Phenibut gave me no feeling whatsoever at the end. I was depressed and anxious everyday so I finally said fuck it and threw away the rest of my stash. I had tried tapering and it was shit. I didn't want to go through 4 months of slowly tapering a dose. For some people, it definitely works better but I am an all or nothing kind of girl. I ordered baclofen which never came. I didn't even need it. I am prescribed lyrica which helped a lot. I don't use any drugs or alcohol and haven't for three years, except Kratom and phenibut. But for this cold turkey, I obtained enough xanax to help me sleep for the night and some thc capsules with a high CBD content. Somehow, with these aids available I suffered very little. I have gotten 8 hrs every night. I took next week off work because I thought I was going to be in a psych ward, but just told my boss I can come in tomorrow and use that PTO for something better. Cold turkey worked so well for me and I truly feel like I'm lucky that I didn't experience the withdrawals as bad as many other reports on here. I'm on day 6 and I'm doing great. I have less anxiety than when I was on phenibut. It is a useful tool for those who can control it. I'm a prior heroin and benzo addict. I have no moderation with any substance. I am so grateful phenibut is out of my life. If anyone needs someone to talk to please feel free to reach out. This post is NOT to advise people to go cold turkey. It is just what worked for me. For those who can handle a slow or aggressive taper it is a lot easier on the body. So kava and Kratom were super helpful. The xanax was a godsend for sleep. I took gotu kola, and magnesium and smoked about 100 cigarettes a day but I made it!! ",Insomnia

8ysbpe,"I'm a recovering drug addict, so I'd be willing to be a guinea pig for this stuff.
It seems very similar to Baclofen, but stronger. 
I hear that they're looking into GABA as the go-to neurotransmitter for treating addiction because things like Baclofen reduce craving intensity and duration, help combat depression and anxiety, dull physical and emotional pain or trauma, and reduce impulsivity. 
It's pretty interesting to learn about. 
I think the primary receptor they're focusing on is GABAb, since obviously most things that agonize GABAa could either be considered a relapse, lead to bad decision making, or just aren't really sustainable for long-term treatment, as benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol have the most deadly withdrawal symptoms of any other drugs. 
While I'd ask if you guys knew where to get these, unfortunately the rules prohibit it. ", craving

The last week before I quit I started needing more than 5.2 grams to avoid the terrible anxiety I would get rebounding off phenibut. I had to just be done. I just threw out all of my phenibut. I have xanax for one week, but one week only. I use kratom and I have some good indica edibles. I don't usually smoke weed anymore but it seems to be helping. 36 hours in, so far so good. I took next week off work because I know that it will most likely get worse. From what I hear, withdrawals really set in 48-72 hours in. I also am prescribed lyrica which helps as well. I have baclofen on the way that should be arriving today. My question is, should I skip the baclofen? Will that just prolong my withdrawals? I think if I can make it without it I definitely will avoid it. Anyone have any cold turkey experiences? Advice? If it stays the way it is I can definitely handle this, but I know it is probably going to get worse. Wish me luck!!!! Fuck phenibut.",anxiety

I have six 2 mg films left to cut down and that is it.  Family said I cannot get more subs to do a softer, less invasive taper.  I am open to any and all suggestions and  would love some support as I get this done to enter sober living.  I have gabapentin, doxepin, baclofen and clonidine to help with the wd's.  I tried cutting the film in half down to 1mg and holy hell I was flip flopping in bed feeling super restless and out of my mind irritable. 

Anyway, today I tool around 1.75.  Will see how it goes.  I read that taking little pieces rather than the whole dose at once helps?  Any links and reading material to educate my family would be appreciated.  I am hoping after reading all the info they may allow me to get a script but I am definitly not counting on it.

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past 8 years and have been on a variety of medications. The one I’ve been on recently (the past 3 years) has been Cymbalta(duloxetine). Cymbalta is a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). I started the process of detoxing with my doctor’s permission 6 months ago.. we went from 60 mg to 30mg. The first 2 weeks were rough ( brain zaps, throwing up, hallucinations, mood swings and exhaustion. I have not received approval for lower the dose for 30mg to 20mg. My doctor is nervous to drop my medication due to work and school. I feel like every time we have tried detoxing ( 3 different occasions) my doctor has an excuse as to why we shouldn’t detox. Each time I have gave in and ended up switching meds and my doctor wants to always up the dose. I’ve taken this apon myself to finish the detox process. I will be lower my dose over the next couple of months and will be incorporating natural remedies, relaxation methods, exercise and hopefully any other helpful advise you guys might have. Please give any advice you feel will be helpful during this process or any other comments you might have. I will be giving updates on my process. Thank you for reading.

8y1f25,"I've lived with my Nmother on and off since she divorced my Nfather when I was 15 years old. Prior to going on the medication -- [Cymbalta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duloxetine) \-- she was pretty awful: emotionally unstable, constant temper tantrums, threats of violence -- the works. She decided she wanted to go to therapy because of her anxiety. The nurse at the therapist's office prescribed Cymbalta, and she's taken it regularly since that time, even though she stopped going to therapy.

Ever since she began Cymbalta, I've noticed that her emotional instability and temper tantrums seem to be muted and reduced; she no longer blows up at the slightest provocation (real or imagined). Don't get me wrong -- she's still the same narcissist she was before: if anyone starts to talk about themselves, she'll just kind of ""tune out"" of the conversation with this glassy-eyed look on her face. She's still disconnected from reality. But she's managing to *pretend* that she's a better person, if that makes sense. For example, if we're in town on an errand, and she sees a homeless person, she'll make a big deal about feeling sorry for them and giving them some money in a way that obviously suggests her reasons for helping them are self-serving. It's pretty weird . . . but at least she's not screaming at them anymore.

Her temper tantrums have not gone away entirely: about once every six months, when she fucks up and can't avoid admitting that she fucked up, there will be an incredible fight as she blames others -- mostly me -- for her problems and hurls every sort of abusive name and hurtful phrase she can think of -- everything from ""ungrateful"" to ""liar"". But this is a marked change from having these sorts of episodes *literally every week*.

The point of my post is to indicate that, while medication will not change an N's essential narcissism, it can possibly mute their worst traits and make it more bearable to live with them. Perhaps that information might help some of you who are also still stuck with your Ns. Ultimately, however, I believe the best thing is to get out and reduce contact; I haven't spoken to my abusive Nfather in several years, and I don't miss him in the slightest. I'm working on reducing contact with my Nmother as well.

For me personally, therapy has been amazing; it has radically changed my life for the better. Here's some advice for getting the most out of therapy: try to have a concrete goal. My goal was, ""I want to be a more productive writer."" My therapist and I worked at it -- with her providing steps for me to take, and with me taking those steps -- until it happened. I'm far more productive than I used to be, and I'm well on my way toward supporting myself as a writer and moving out. (My therapist also readily acknowledged how abusive my family was to me, which was immensely validating.) If your therapist isn't helping you, find a new one. Yes, it can be discouraging; I've been there. But keep trying. It's worth the effort.

I binged OC 80's over the past year but never more than 1-2 weeks, and I personally feel pretty horrible withdrawals (obviously relative as heavier users will face much worse withdrawals). My withdrawals from opioids mainly consist of pain in my stomach, loss of appetite, insomnia, night sweats, RLS and diarrhea. However, this is how I would rank my worst withdrawals:

1) Getting off a 2 year habit of daily Clonazepam (Klonopin)/Lorazepam (Ativan)/Xanax (Alprazolam) habit. Obviously I started off at 0.5mg, then 1mg, then 3mg, 6mg. By the end of it I was doing 8-10mg usually half Clonazepam as soon as I woke up and then the rest Xanax throughout the day. I quit cold turkey because tapering never worked for me.

BY FAR the worst type of withdrawals I've ever experienced. The rebound anxiety was like no other. I had one of the worst panic attacks I've ever experienced. Ended up in the hospital because my parents thought I was dying. Luckily no seizures and the worst was over about 2 weeks after I quit.

2) Gabapentin/Pregabalin (Neurontin/Pregabalin): I'm mentioning this not only because of how bad the withdrawals were, but because many people think that these two drugs are relatively harmless and non-addictive. Well, I was doing anywhere from 900mg-1200mg of Pregablin some days, and 4500mg-5000mg of Gabapentin other days. The Gabapentin I would space out in 30 minute intervals throughout the entire day. I know this is A LOT more than most people take, but they gave me euphoria unlike any other (not as good as opiates though). At first, I didn't realize my withdrawal symptoms were caused by these gaba drugs. I suffered for several weeks with EXTREME pain in my stomach. I often resorted to Hydrocodone/Oxycodone to numb the pain. This accompanied severe cramps in my stomache and not eating at all. Overall, this wasn't as bad as getting off the Benzo's but it was much worse than any opioid withdrawals I've had.

3) Oxy/Hydrocodone: Now these two, I would only binge 1-2 weeks at a time and then taking another 3 weeks off usually. However, I was taking pretty high doses compared to my tolerance since it would somewhat reset every 3 weeks but I'd continue with the same dose I left off. Some of you may have seen my posts regarding tapering these last couple of days. I get similar withdrawals to gabapentin in that I have severe pain in my stomach, but it doesn't match the pain caused by the gaba drugs. Also, this time I am tapering off rather than quitting cold turkey so it's been a much better experience.

It’s strange. I was put onto pregabalin yesterday and it’s made my bladder seem to act differently. It’s holding more  Urine. And I can sometimes pee upto 250mls. But it feels like there’s something going on and I’m wondering if it’s because it also acts on the gaba receptors?

8ytjvm,"Hey r/socialanxiety,

I've decided to write a brief guide on overcoming social anxiety disorder, and instead of posting it on some blog nobody will read, I think here is a good place for it., among a community of people who can relate to this disorder and want help in getting better. Without going into my own story too much, suffice to say social anxiety severely impacted my life for years. I skipped presentation modules in college, I didn't join clubs at college, and I shaped my entire career around working from home so I could avoid people. 

I've only recently properly treated this debilitating condition (I'm 27), and I wanted to share what works in the hope of helping some of you out, particularly those of you who really feel the effects of social anxiety.

# Social Anxiety vs Social Anxiety Disorder

It's very important to firstly distinguish between social anxiety and social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety is something that practically everyone feels to some extent in social situations, particularly pressurized situations or intimidating/new social situations. There is no point in trying to never ever feel social anxiety because that is completely impractical: even the most extroverted people feel it from time to time.  

Social anxiety disorder is an entirely more severe manifestation of anxiety wherein social anxiety causes significant negative effects on peoples' lives due to the beliefs and thought patterns we develop because of our anxieties. I read somewhere that social anxiety disorder is an ""illness of lost opportunities"" which sums it up perfectly. To check the severity of your anxiety, I'd recommend the [Liebowitz social anxiety scale](http://nationalsocialanxietycenter.com/liebowitz-sa-scale/). 

# Exercise

There is no excuse whatsoever not to exercise. I am a lazy prick and I avoided regular exercise for years. However, I read a book called Spark The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain written by a psychiatrist named John Ratey and it completely changed my mind. It's a really interesting read, and the author goes into scientific detail on why exercise is so good at treating anxiety disorders. 

I always advocate doing exercise you enjoy but anything at all is better than nothing. Some people with social anxiety find it hard to leave their homes, so in that situation I'd start with bodyweight squats, pushups, or perhaps an exercise bike if you have room. If you are comfortable going outside, go for a run or cycle for 20-30 mins every day. Believe me when I say exercise makes the biggest difference to this condition. 

For any of you who are interested in the reasoning and science behind exercise as an excellent anxiety treatment, here's a link to that Spark book. I'd really recommend it. [https://amzn.to/2uxcSTv](https://amzn.to/2uxcSTv)

# The Social Anxiety Cycle

Everyone who suffers from social anxiety disorder is stuck in a cycle that can be hard to get out of. However, once you know about the cycle you can address different aspects of it.

1. People with social anxiety tend to have high perceived social standards (my voice should never crack when I speak, I shouldn't blush, etc.) and beliefs, and assumptions (if people want to talk to me they'll let me know). 
2. The above leads to apprehension when faced with the prospect of social situation. How could you not feel nervous when your social standards are so high?
3. The apprehension feeds into heightened self-focused attention during situations. You find it really hard to relax and be present when speaking to people. You notice every little mistake you make, every time your face goes a little red, every slightly awkward pause in a conversation. 
4. You then associate social situations and your social skills with a negative self-perception, and you see social situations as carrying an estimated high probability of turning out shitty. 
5. Because of the above, you start to use safety behaviors, such as looking at your phone or making sure you're never the center of attention, and avoidance behaviors, like not turning up for social events, skipping presentations, etc. 
6. The very fact you're avoiding social situations or using safety behaviors during them reinforces the idea that social situations are something to be feared. You then return to step two with each new and intimidating social situation, strengthening the anxiety.

# Beliefs

Beliefs are really at the core of social anxiety, and they are what influence your high perceived social standards and assumptions. Addressing your beliefs can be quite painful but also extremely helpful. 

Some beliefs I found out I had: 

* I'm to unattractive to talk to. 
* I'm too shy to speak to strangers.
* Other people always judge me and know when I'm nervous. 
* The onus is on me to keep conversations going. 
* I don't have the ability to deal with being the center of attention. 
* I am unable to make small talk. 

Beliefs seem incontrovertibly true, and unfortunately, the only way to challenge them is to actually test them. This means taking action and recording the outcomes of these mini-experiments in an unbiased way to get an accurate assessment of how true your beliefs are. 

To challenge my belief about small talk, I decided to go to Starbucks and ask the barista about recommended items from the menu, before moving onto small talk like the weather. I felt awkward but still, the key result was not that I'm unable to make small talk with strangers, and it wasn't actually anywhere near as uncomfortable as I'd assumed.    

# Confidence

One of the main barriers to taking action on overcoming social anxiety is the idea that us social anxiety suffers are inherently lacking in confidence in all aspects of life. However, it's important to remember that confidence isn't something you either have or don't have; it actually depends on what you're doing. For example, I'm really confident in my ability to cook a decent meal. Never undervalue the significance of things you're confident about. 

# CBT

Therapy can be great for social anxiety, and the majority of therapists nowadays use a CBT approach for this disorder. What I like about CBT is mostly that it helps you question the thoughts that come into your mind automatically and re-frame them in a more rational way.  

# Books

Overcoming social anxiety is more about taking action than intellectualizing everything. In fact, I did this for years by reading tons of books and I came to realize that reading books was another form of avoiding social interactions. 

Saying that, I recommend two exceptional books, the first of which clarifies everything you need to know about how social anxiety works and why you're trapped in it. 

[Overcoming Social Anxiety and Shyness](https://amzn.to/2ulClA8) by Gillian Butler.  An absolute essential read for any social anxiety sufferer. 

[The Happiness Trap](https://amzn.to/2umVodq) by Russ Harris. Depression often accompanies social anxiety, and this excellent book helped me re-define my understanding of happiness and how to live in alignment with my values. 

# Medication

For many people, addressing social anxiety seems an almost impossible task, and this is where medication can be of great assistance. Anti-depressants are commonly prescribed, however,they don't work for everyone. I'd recommend trying a maximum of 3 SSRIs for a period of 6 weeks each and if nothing works by then, it's time for a different med. Lexapro, Sertraline (Zoloft), and Paroxetine (Paxil) are all well-researched and agreed treatments for social anxiety disorder. 

Benzodiazepines are also an option, and they can provide excellent relief. The problem is you can become dependant on them quite easily so I really only recommend them for moment of sheer panic. Clonazepam is a good option. 

# Conclusion

I hope some of this post has been helpful to even one person: if it has then I'll consider the time writing this as time well spent. Overcoming social anxiety disorder is very possible, it just takes a concerted effort on your behalf to do it, which I know any of you can if a lazy fucker like me can! Good luck!",dependant

Thursday I went to the sinus doctor, got a CT scan done and discovered I had many problems. To avoid surgery, I was put on another round of antibiotics(after I had failed three rounds) to try and clear up the problems. I was prescribed a seriously intense brand called Levaquin, which side effects include:  diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hemorrhaging, fainting, etc. The doctor talked about these with me, and although I had no problems in the past, she suggested I take some pro-biotics, so I did. 

The first day of taking these new pills I went out to my favorite Vietnamese place for lunch and had a big steaming bowl of beef  pho with a shrimp spring roll . It was very yummy and I continued my day as normal. I started feeling bad around 5 o'clock and by 6 I vomited everything up so forcefully i had to blow it out my nose (gross, I know). I felt immediately better , thinking I had just had too much to eat, but then i threw up again, this time with diarrhea so bad it was very liquidy. I stopped eating and drinking and just sad on the couch in stomach pain so awful I almost thought about going to the hosptial. My stomach pain reached levels like 7 and 8 on my pain scale, and for me that was pretty high. I continuned to throw up stomach acid until 3am and that was the end of the throw up episode. During this time i had no other symptoms than intense abdominal pain in the belly button/right lower side, vomiting and bad diarrhea. I never ran a fever once.  The next day I slept for about 18 hours. I was still sick to my stomach and had been up pretty late in pain. I drank sips of water but I didnt eat. My stomach muscles were killing me, but I was getting better. I had not touched the pills since the first day. 

The next couple of days I went to work, ate minimally, and slept  a lot. Then, the last 24 hours have been odd. I have started ""spotting"" or bleeding a little. This is odd because I have  very high dose birth control pills that I still managed to take everyday of this illness to prevent me from having month long bleeding cycles. For the sake of this post I am not sexually active. As I have gone to the bathroom through the day I have noticed more and more blood and this is scaring me. I also have awful cramps( something my normal period doesn't come with ). 

Anyway, Im not sure what is going on, but Im afaid something could be seriously messed up. I am not sure if this was all caused by the meds or by the food. I am in so much pain. Please help. Thanks ",diarrhea

8zqbfy,"Hi I've been suffering from bipolar disorder for many years but instead of medicating for it, I have been self-managing it by isolating myself.

I've recently had a lot of problems in my life and I'm finding myself very weepy all the time and just generally down in the dumps with negative thinking.

I was once on all the medications for bipolar like anticonvulsant epilim,  quetiapine and pro zac,  but all it did was Make Me Feel sick all the time and unable to do anything it didn't make me happier or more productive. So I stopped and eventually came right.... but now I'm thinking about asking only for an antidepressant so I don't cry all the time. If anybody with type 2 BPD has experience with this please let me know what you did to get back to normal. Thanks",Feel sick

8yiqkx,"Jane is a very dear friend to me. I've known Jane for 3 years; although it is not mutual, I consider Jane to be my current best friend, and one of the best friends I have ever had. Because of her, I was able to overcome some difficult times during which I had no other friends, which I'm always very grateful for (I never told her because that's weird).

Jane told me before that she had a period of severe depression over the 3 months from December 2017 to March this year, which sadly she decided to cope with by doing dangerous amounts of nitrous (laughing gas). But it was only yesterday that she told me about it in dreadful, heartbreaking detail.

She had a history with drugs but according to her it never got out of hand until that 3 months. I never met Jane in person during that time; when I finally met her, aside from suffering from her chronic insomnia, she appeared to be in acceptable physical and metal health, which was one of the reasons why I overlooked her problem; I still regret very much not being concerned as much as I should have been until now.

She described herself during that 3 months as totally dysfunctional, that all she did was doing literal hundreds of canisters of nitrous until she passes out only to wake up and do some more. She finds herself awake at night and bursting into tears ""for no reason"", and she said there had been voices in her head, voices she knew weren't real but still answered, she said she answered quietly because she didn't want her roommate to hear. She is excused from university for half a year or so. Her counselor at her university made her seek help by having someone at a help center check up on her by calling her every single day, although she told the person on the second day not to call her anymore. Jane hinted that she had suicidal thoughts one night, she was scared something would happen so she decided to go to the help center, asking to stay until morning comes. Instead of offering help, the piece of human garbage on shift that night told Jane to go to the hospital. And so she did, she went to the emergency department, they told her that she couldn't stay since it was"" for emergencies only"". Jane left for home, on the way she got a call from the help center from earlier, apologizing and begging her not to go home and instead, stay at the help center for the night. She went home, and thankfully nothing happened that night.

She talked about such horrible things so calmly, in a nonchalant way like she was talking about the plot in a movie that she saw. Jane has always been a private person who keeps secrets, she feels comfortable being distant. I felt awful that I had no idea these things happened, and I would never know if she just decided not to tell me. The thought that I was completely unaware that she was going through all that and that I made absolutely fucking zero effort to help her made me feel miserable, and I was so afraid of what could've happened, I feel like I was going to cry, I didn't, good thing I don't have a heart, I guess. I'm really thankful she decided to tell me all these things, although if she sees this post she'll never tell me anything ever again, hell, I don't think she'd even talk to me again, I guess because I can't mind my own goddamn business. I don't blame her, though.

Jane started seeing a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist prescribed her Quetiapine (she only told me she was prescribed antipsychotics for schizophrenia, I found out what they were when I saw the bottle of pills in her bathroom). She didn't stick to the pills, she told me they gave her nightmares, and that the pills made her ""feel detached from reality"". She said the psychiatrist wasn't any help because ""it's not like he told her anything she didn't know or he actually cared"". At that point all I could say was that I care.

Fortunately she decided to be done with nitrous by being fucking hardcore and cut it cold turkey, it has been successful up to this point and I'm SO proud of her. HOWEVER Jane is returning to her university: her main source of anxiety and stress. Honestly I'm so fucking worried. She told me there were times she was really tempted to do nitrous again, although she is determined not to relive those days, I dread the thought of other possibilities. I just hope she can get through this addiction, there's nothing more important, I don't even care if we will ever talk again, I just don't want her to have to go through all that ever again.

And I really hope I could do something more than writing this sad cry for help on reddit.

TL;DR: My friend told me she was suicidal and addicted, and there's nothing I want more than being helpful to her.

p.s. This had been painful to write, having to recall what happened to Jane and the fact that I did absolutely nothing for her, at some points I almost gave up writing but I'm glad I didn't. I guess I still have some conscience left in me. Having written this much I now realize maybe it's for the best that I show Jane this post, just so she knows that somebody cares, not just me, but also strangers on reddit who take their time to help out. The longer I wait the weirder it's gonna be. To Jane it might seem like I'm overreacting, but at this point I don't really give a fuck if we ever talk again, as long as this helps.","nightmares,"

I'm almost positive it's the NSI-189, because I also experience anxiety on it and that's one of its side effects.

8z4j48,"I am generally happy with my mom’s neuro. After a series of doctors he actually diagnosed her for which I am eternally grateful. He has an academic appointment out of a major research institution and is well versed in the current literature. He’s published. He’s pleasant to my mother and helped to get her anxiety semi-under control with meds. 

BACKGROUND/CONCERNS
1.) While her neuro has worked out of the same research institution for years, his satellite offices (where my mom sees him) have changed multiple times over the past decade. This happened again in June. 

2.) This transition has been “bumpy” in terms of communication with the new support staff and information seems very confused.  I tried to reschedule my mom’s appt. and get her meds filled and was met with outright hostility, their refusal to call my cell phone, and the statement from staff that “Dr. X has never even heard of your mom so I don’t know where you got his name from.” Charming, instills a lot of confidence in the doctor and the administration of his office. 

Her appointment at the new place is Tuesday, so I’m going to try to feel the place out in person. But I’m going there with a lot of skepticism. 

3.) I’m not sure we are getting much out of office visits. His nurse (who I don’t think transitioned to the new office) did a brief cognitive evaluation of my mom over year ago at her first appointment, but that was the first and only time. During office visits the doctor asks about her anxiety and if she is having bathroom accidents but that’s about it. He also doesn’t speak to me separately, so i am not free to fully express what’s going on because it upsets my mom. 

4.) I don’t feel like the doctor and I are on the same page with the meds. He hasn’t upped my mom’s anxiety meds in 9 months because he wants her to be on Alzheimer’s meds which he says will help with her mood. Unfortunately the Aricept made her psychotic and the insurance won’t cover the Memantine. I actually give zero shits about her being on Alzheimer’s meds: their effectiveness particularly out of the early stages are “meh” at best, her neuro actually published an article stating just this, and I don’t understand the point of extending her misery (and ours). I honestly just want her distress alleviated through palliative care. 

QUESTIONS: 
1.) Is a neurologist necessary or even advantageous once the disease has been diagnosed? 
2.) If they are necessary, what should an office visit with a neuro look like? What should we be getting out of it in terms of information and treatment?
3.) If they are not necessary who should I take her to in order to manage her psychiatric issues? A geriatrician? A psychiatrist? Her GP?",psychotic

8yh3ru,"I suffer from severe chronic (Treatment resistant) depression, and ketamine therapy is one of the last things I have hope in (as well as ECT). But neither are covered by my medicaid, and I definitely can't afford them anytime soon.

But just curious, I know with ketamine infusions they give a relatively low dose compared to what one would take 'recreationally'. 

I have been using memantine on and off for almost  a year, not everyday though, but I will take it before stims, to help and reduce tolerance to them, and also these past few months, I have really been 'abusing' 3meo/3ho pcp. I have stopped, but realize I built up a massive tolerance to dissos.

I only used ketamine a handful of times, I got some recently, to try and experiment/self-medicate, and noticed I must have a massive tolerance to dissos. Because even 200mg IV was not enough to khole, and I was able to walk, talk and function normally on that dose, the effects are also very short lived

So this makes me wonder, If I ever want to get ketamine infusion therapy, will it still be effective? Will I need much higher doses? Will my disso tolerance ever go away?

I've read some reports of people using memantine recreationally, and that it kinda created a 'permanent' disso tolerance for them, anyone have experience with this? Is my tolerance more likely from the memantine or /-pcps?",tolerance

8zm1cc,"This is kind of a rant, but I thought you guys might have some insight, too. 

In 2014, I had a stomach illness that lasted a long time. I was prescribed Reglan (metoclopromide), and it gave me a severe anxiety attack. I ended up at he emergency room, because I didn't realize that's what it was. All I knew was that my heart was beating really fast and I was pacing like a caged lion.  I stopped taking the Reglan, but the anxiety continued. I was afraid to be alone and I was crying a lot. I had had a major depressive episode in 2001 and was on Zoloft for several years. I hated being on antidepressants. Because of the Reglan episode, my mom pushed me into taking Cymbalta. I really hated the thought of it. I remember having a dream where I was in a dank tile room and every time I took a pill, another link in a chain that would chain me to the wall would appear. But my parents kept pushing, so I started taking it. I've been on it since then. It hasn't been terrible, but I still hate it.

Now, I'm looking to moving from where I live in Arkansas to Tennessee where I grew up. Things have gotten really bad at my job, and my brother and his wife and child who were here have moved away, so it's been hard to deal with here. I don't know if I'll be able to have a job in Tennessee before I move there, so I wanted to wean off of the Cymbalta so that I won't have to stop cold turkey if/when my insurance runs out. My mom has agreed to come to Arkansas to stay with me while I get off the drug, but instead of being supportive, she's got me afraid to share any withdrawals I might be experiencing because she overreacts to everything. So, now I've got to hide that. She's said she's sorry she ever pushed me to get on the drug because now that I've said I want to get of it, she's actually read about it and discovered that it can be really hard on someone to get off of it. 

I really hate the attitude toward anti-depressants, as if it's some sort of cure-all. Here, eat these magic beans and everything will be great. Translation: here, eat these magic beans because I don't want to actually be there for you.",anxiety

8zg35w,"Relaxation methods during withdrawal

I’m currently going through withdrawal while I’m coming off my Cymbalta medication. I just thought I would create a list of relaxation methods to try if anyone else is going through the same hell. Here we go!

•	Meditation/ breathing: I know this sounds silly but it’s important. When your detoxing from the meds you are overwhelmed with emotions and it’s hard to focus on feeling better. Remember to take at least 5 minutes a day to take a deep breath or meditate in a quiet environment. 

•	Exercise: this will be great for releasing energy if you were speeding like me. I had odd spurts of energy and would try to clean or organize everything in the house lol. Try to do some floor exercises or if your feeling up to it try walking at the gym. Don’t push yourself too hard but try to wear yourself out a little to bring that energy down so you can relax.
•	Rest: The most important method of healing! Rest !rest! rest! It might be the only thing you want to do for a couple of days, and that is perfectly fine! Sleep if you can, but if you can’t just lay back and do something that relaxes you. .read a book, watch Netflix, scroll through Reddit ;).

•	Healthy eating and keeping Hydrated: During withdrawal the body can experience a number of nutritional issues You will usually lose your appetite, forget to drink water and unfortunately there is a chance you will have some bowel issues ( I know it’s not fun to talk about).. So.. all I have to say is try to eat a little bit of something each day and don’t make it a greasy cheeseburger. Try to get something nutritional like veggies, fruit, chicken.. something that’s not filled with grease. Also keep water on standby. I know you don’t want it but try to drink some water every hour to stay hydrated. You don’t realize it but if your getting sick or having bowel issues you will become dehydrated quick.

•	Hot Epsom Salt Baths With Sensory Brush ( Body Brush): this is so far the one thing that really helps me relax and I look forward to at the end of the day now. Many individuals in recovery  from opiate addiction report that taking a hot bath is a helpful trick that can improve the experience of some withdrawal symptoms. Muscle aches and pains, headaches, and back pain can be relaxed away by soaking in hot water, and the relaxation can help improve sleep. Epsom salt added to the water aids in soothing sore muscles. Also using a Sensory Brush on your skin while you soak will help soothe your skin crawling feeling. 

If anyone has more helpful relaxation tips please comment! A lot of people are going through this hell and the more help the better. :)

8zd7az,"A couple of years ago I took Bupropion (300mg) for around 11-12 months.  In that time I lost around 35-40 lbs, which was very pleasant.  But then my doctor prescribed me Cymbalta (30mg) which I took in unison with Bupropion for a couple of months before stopping the Bupropion and just taking the Cymbalta (now 60mg).  I was on Cymbalta for a few months before switching to Pristiq (25mg) for a few months.  During this SNRI period without Bupropion, I gained back 35 lbs.  I eventually became fed up with the SNRIs' side effects (weight gain, fatigue, night sweats, etc. just for a small increase in my depression) and am back back on Bupropion.  I've been back on Bupropion for a couple of months and haven't taken Pristiq since the beginning of this period.  I have noticed that Bupropion isn't having any of the same weight loss effects it did prior to my SNRI period.  Could the SNRIs have effected my metabolism to the point where Buproprion no longer causes weight loss?  If so, do you think this is a permanent effect?  If not and you don't believe there is a causation, what do you think could be causing my inability to lose weight on Bupropion?  I have been eating healthy and exercising since restarting Bupropion.  Note: I've been on Methylphenidate ER (54mg) this entire time.

Please understand I'm not interested in losing weight solely for vanity reasons.  Growing up I was an athlete and was use to being in shape or at least not very much out of shape.  My mid-late 20s hit (I'm early 30s now) and I gained 40-45 lbs due to lack of exercise, bad eating and overall lack of care if I was fat or not.  After taking Bupropion the first time and losing that extra weight I gained, I felt amazing.  Yeah, it was nice having a fit body and not being super self-conscious about my weight, but I also had more energy as well as confidence in public settings where I have bad social anxiety.  This also improved my outlook on life and generally made me feel better as a person.  Bupropion seems to be the only consistent thing that helped me lose weight.  I've always had issues losing extra weight even with exercise and good eating habits.  I could maintain my weight with exercise and eating right, but always lost weight at a snail-slow speed no matter what I did.

Another thing, I'm newish to the whole depression-treating scene.  Most of my life I've experienced depression but always thought it was normal and everyone went through it but they were just better at dealing with it.  It wasn't until I talked to a psychologist that I discovered this isn't a normal condition and can be treated.  ",weight gain

8z7zsk,"28 y/o female, 215 pounds, non-smoker. First diagnosed with migraines at age 16, and typically have between 3-8 migraine days per month but are not typically more than 2 days per migraine. Other medical history includes Asthma, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, and Fibromyalgia. Am also currently undergoing a work up by a cardiologist for tachycardia. 

Current medications include Topiramate 100mg 2x daily, Cymbalta 60 mg, Meloxicam 15 mg, Tramadol 15 mg as needed, Imitrex 100mg as needed, Phenargan (unsure of mg) as needed. I also have the injectable form of Imitrex as well as the nasal spray. I also have the Mirena IUD to treat symptoms of PCOS. I take B12 injections and prescription strength vitamin D supplements as I have chronic deficiencies in both, use Naproxen over the counter to treat my headaches, as well as CBD hemp oil. 

This current migraine came on at the beginning of May. My neurologist has her patients call if migraines last longer than three days. At that point, she had me come in for a Toradol shot and prescribed a Medrol dose pack, which I completed without any relief to my migraine. At that point, she had me come in for an IV infusion of Reglan, Benadryl, and Toradol. This still did not provide relief. 

She then scheduled me for a 5 day IV infusion protocol of Dexamethasone, Magnesium, and Valproate. The Valproate made me quite sick to my stomach, but I was able to control it with Phenargan. I had a slight improvement of my symptoms after this infusion and was able to return to work but symptoms returned full. Last after a week and a half. My neurologist was out of the office, but the other neurologist prescribed oral Reglan, Benadryl, and Toradol to take over the weekend until my neurologist would be back in the office. 

My neurologist set up another round of the same 5 day IV infusion as before. This time, between pain from the migraine and the Valproate, I was very sick to my stomach, and was beginning to not keep much food or fluids down. Needless to say, this didn’t have the best outcome, and my migraine was still persistent even after this round. 

I wound up in the ER because I got dehydrated, which was messing with my tachycardia. In the ER I got fluids as well as another round of the Reglan/Benadryl/Toradol cocktail and trigger point injections (which helped temporarily but wore off after 8 hours). 

My neurologist then set me up for a 5 day DHE infusion protocol. The first day I handled relatively well, although it made me nauseous. The second day, however, I became incredibly nauseous. At this point, I also hadn’t had been able to keep down food or liquid in days, my heart rate was running steadily in the 130’s with spikes up higher. That night, I got disoriented, and was still disoriented the next day. When my wife took me in for my infusion, the nurse immediately sent me down to the ER. My HR was in the 160’s, my blood sugar was 49...it wasn’t pretty. They gave me two bags of fluid, and admitted me. 

While I was in the hospital, I had an MRI and an LP. Both were clean. The disorientation was concerning to them, but that mostly cleared up once they started giving me bags of dextrose. The migraine never faded, but my heart rate did come back down to a more reasonable range. At that point, I was discharged. 

At this point I’m about a week and a half post discharge. The migraine still has not abated. I still am not able to keep enough food or liquid down to keep myself properly hydrated - my PCP ordered a bag of fluids for me and is looking into making it a standing order either at the hospital or for home health, but I’m down 15 pounds in less than 3 weeks. 

My neurologist at this point is completely stumped. She’s thrown everything she knows to throw at it. She is thinking that at this point the migraine may be secondary to the cardiac issue that I was having and she wants me to follow up with my cardiologist...but to me this sounds like a cop-out. If I were having blood pressure issues I could see it, but my blood pressure is perfect, my issue is tachycardia so I don’t see how they’re related but I’m hardly the expert. 

I am currently waiting for a referral to a headache specialist, but I’m hoping that someone here may think of something helpful I can take back to my neurologist until then.

8z7ch8,"I started getting early simptoms in December 2015, lived through a total life breakdown for 2 years, diagnosed last year and have been taking cymbalta since. 

I went through the initial weird pain, the desperation of doctors not believing, teachers and other authorities thinking I was just lazy, friendships lost, relationship broken. Dropped school, couldn't get a job, enormous bills. The fear of never getting better. The hatred towards life for giving me this. Suicidal thoughts, side effects. You name it. I was an utter mess.

After around a year of been taking this medication, I'm finally functional: I'm continuing school next month, I have a part job, the bills are being taking care for... I'm even going to the gym and doing exercise!! This would have seem impossible a year back but I'm finally here. 

I've still got a lot to go through, but I've learnt about myself and my body and I'll always struggle more than the average healthy guy. I learnt that I'm capable of doing my life now that I've got the diagnosis and treatment that I need.

She comes back into the room and has another doctor with her, one I have never seen before. The new doc starts lecturing me on my ibuprofen usage. How I was killing my liver.

I’ve taken ibuprofen...4 times in my life. I’m 30. She ripped into me saying I am killing myself. Two years ago, I started having anaphylaxis to nsaids but I’m killing my liver? I’m so angry! I’ve fought for a year and a half to get my primary to take me serious about my thyroid tests (turns out I have Hashimotos) and fought with them for 7 years for other issues they thought I was making up (being tested for mast cell disorders now). 

Sure, I am killing my liver and not all the doctors that have ignored my pleas for help. 

She ended the “conversation” with, just tough out the fibro. A good day is a pain level of a 5 or below. I am constantly between a 7-8, but tough out the fibro. I haven’t ever  taken anything for my fibro besides gaba and cymbalta and I didn’t stay on them long.

Im not sleepy either, just a little bit sedated and slower than normal breathing but still hardly off normal. I also wrote this sentence while fearing going into respiratory depression.

I posted a few days ago about tapering down from my oxycodone script. I have that part figured out but I was curious about using Lyrica for withdrawal? I have been prescribed Lyrica but never took it on a regular basis and I heard it could be used to ease withdrawal from opiate? How would I use it and at what point would I start using it?

I got it today it from a friend who’s also a dealer, and who knows her shit. She took some from the same batch (about an eighth of a gram, so half of what I’ve just taken) and says it’s nice and strong. Her tolerance is apparently so high now that she’s gonna stop taking Mandy for a while, but this stuff worked well for her.

I managed to get a gram (actually about 9.8) for £30. I split it into 4 empty paracetamol capsules because I’m a simpleton who can’t make bombs for shit. My partner and I each took one and saved one each for another day.

I’m on a lot of other medication: venlafaxine, propranolol, mirtazapene and co-codamol for suspected fibromyalgia- all on prescription. I also gummed the little bit of residue from the baggie and the scales.

My partner took the same dose (minus the residue) and he’s on antipsychotics (risperidone) along with venlafaxine and lyrica.

I *think* I’ve had something close to this dose before and it was good. I can’t be completely sure of the dose because someone had already made it into bombs before I got it (kinda dumb for me to take random bombs, I know). 

I talked for about 12 hours straight about my life and memories and shit, and wrote a 2,000 word essay about my mental health and why I am the way I am.  Deep shit, basically. It was a great, long-lasting roll.

However, my comedown was awful. I saw weird patterns on surfaces, and half-formed shadow people out of the corners of my eyes. I also cried and was really achy (especially my joints and jaw) for a couple of days afterwards. I also did cartwheels and round-offs while rolling, which made the aches (mainly in my legs, feet and back) worse. I also have mysterious chronic pain (my doctor still doesn’t know what’s wrong with me) which did not like the gymnastics I did the day before.

Is a bad comedown the only negative side-effect that my partner and I are  probably gonna get? His comedowns are usually a bit better than mine but he also had 3 beers just before taking it (2.5 units each)

I’ve tried to give as much info as possible so hopefully someone can give me accurate advice.

As for my physical stats, I’m 20, almost 5’8 and 88kg. 

I’m female-to-male transgender, but not  yet on testosterone. Obviously I’m still *technically* biologically female and always will be; I put in this bit about my biological sex because I don’t know if it plays a role in how my body will react to the drug.

I apologise for the long-winded post; I began to feel it starting to hit shortly after I began typing. So far the roll is great- I’m sitting outside in the summer evening air and having a few cigarettes. I know it’s still early days and that there’s always a possibility that the roll will turn sour later. I started a timer when I swallowed the capsule and so far it’s been 48 minutes, making it about 8:50pm local time (England) when I took it.

TLDR; took about 1/4 gram of pure MDMA- will I be OK?", tolerance

Hindsight being 20/20...

I've had basically 24/7 GERD for a month and I couldn't figure out the cause, or why several antacids (40mg Nexium, 300mg Zantac) were not helping that much, so I decided to take the diagnosis into my own hands and try Betaine HCL  (with pepsin) tablets. I took 2-3 pills with some fish and hot dogs (meat only) to see if this would improve my symptoms or make them worse. Figured I would be fine since I was taking a lot of antacids.

Well, certainly things got worse, burning sensation at the base of the esophagus, more bloating,  despite lots of Gaviscon tablets and baking soda to try to counter-act the reaction after 20 minutes. Pain is 2x as bad as normal, followed by some liquid bowel movements shortly thereafter.

It's 3 hours later and I'm still feeling the effects :( I guess this proves definitively that I don't have ""low"" stomach acid, despite being on powerful acid suppressing drugs for  month.

Q1. for right now, Should I keep popping gaviscon in excess of the 12/day max or try something else.

Q2. ~~Is it worth going to ER for some kind of acute powerful antacid treatment? Pain is at a 6/10 level right now~~ Things have calmed down a little after 5 hours of heavy discomfort",burning sensation

8yv62h,"I was on Wellbutrin for a few years in my 20’s then stopped. A few years later new P-doc put me on Celexa and then a few years later I went to Lexapro 20mg (still on it at age 40+). About 10 years back I wanted to improve more so I tried going to Pristiq, but had major incident that caused depression and anxiety. So after a week or so went back on Lexapro. 

How do I know if the symptoms of my attempted change to Pristiq were withdrawal symptoms from SSRI? Or if they were true depression. It was a stop Lexapro and take Pristiq cut. No weaning or anything. 

At some point I was also diagnosed with low testosterone and am now on TRT as well. I believe this has helped tremendously with my so called depression and I think was the cause. So I don’t know if my depression was due to low T or other factors. 

How do I know when is enough? Or do I just keep taking them for the rest of my life?  Do I try weaning off and see what happens? I now have a wife and kids so having a major incident like when I tried to go to Pristiq is very different. Job security and not killing myself are a major concern and having a meltdown would not be good. 

My P-doc says you can try to wean off if you like. But then he also just retired so...he said just take is slow. 20-15-10-15 then done. 

Edit: another note after my Pristiq breakdown my doc added Wellbutrin (I think 150mg non SR) as well. After about a year I weaned off in about a month or so without any issues.  Will that help tell if I will have any weaning issues from SSRI’s?

Thanks in advance. ",depression
8yv62h,"I was on Wellbutrin for a few years in my 20’s then stopped. A few years later new P-doc put me on Celexa and then a few years later I went to Lexapro 20mg (still on it at age 40+). About 10 years back I wanted to improve more so I tried going to Pristiq, but had major incident that caused depression and anxiety. So after a week or so went back on Lexapro. 

How do I know if the symptoms of my attempted change to Pristiq were withdrawal symptoms from SSRI? Or if they were true depression. It was a stop Lexapro and take Pristiq cut. No weaning or anything. 

At some point I was also diagnosed with low testosterone and am now on TRT as well. I believe this has helped tremendously with my so called depression and I think was the cause. So I don’t know if my depression was due to low T or other factors. 

How do I know when is enough? Or do I just keep taking them for the rest of my life?  Do I try weaning off and see what happens? I now have a wife and kids so having a major incident like when I tried to go to Pristiq is very different. Job security and not killing myself are a major concern and having a meltdown would not be good. 

My P-doc says you can try to wean off if you like. But then he also just retired so...he said just take is slow. 20-15-10-15 then done.

8yp6qj,"Hey guys. I've been taking 200mg of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) for around 3 years and it's been the first anti to actually work for me after a long list of failures. Of course there are still negative side effects though, and ideally I'd be on a lower dose or get off it altogether, but from the little I've read online the withdrawal can be pretty brutal.

Does anyone here have experience with it and can share? What did you notice when your dose was cut, if anything?

Thanks in advance!", withdrawal

I’m Zero. I had a benign childhood from of epilepsy called benign rolandic epilepsy. Manifested in part of the brain responsible for learning and emotion. I was diagnosed in 94 pre post status epilepticus advances in aftercare and plasticity. Onward. Developed anger issues , insomnia and emotional restlessness afterwards with severe depression as early as 14 . Drug use ensued and precipitated to standing in the line at local 4th Reich methadone clinic at age 19. Onward. Decade of psyche wards, jails (for painting graffiti on trains) and selfish addicted depravity. Been off methadone and opiate habit for 3 years now with brief relapses using both opiates and cocaine. Using occasionally to supplement the psyche meds I was on . In the last 3 years, those being , pristiq,Zoloft, and off label use of gabapentin for anxiety. I became addicted to Gaba b agonist physically and used phenibut Hcl in conjunction with a dwindling gabapentin supply monthly. I just couldn’t kick the GABA. I went to the psyche emergency room this year pleading for them to detox me from it. The psychiatrist said there was no protocol for such which angered me as I laughed in her face rambling about how it’s similar to benzos and alcohol in how it acts on this main central nervous system transmitter. No one could help me it seemed but myself. I then abruptly stopped both Zoloft 100mg and gabapentin 3200mg daily and replaced them with alcohol(more so cause of physical dependence on GABA). Up until July 7th I was drinking 30 beers a day approximately. Onward. On the night of the 7th having drank all day while attending a 3 day music festival I returned to the campsite to find that our neighbors whom we had become friends with immediately had dosed my fiancé with Liquid LSD (consensually). I then figured I would partake in such not thinking of all I knew of the compound. Most laughter I have had in one day in ten years easily. Most beauty I have seen and felt in 10 plus years in a single night. MDMA was offered. This turned into a deep introspective therapy session between myself my fiancé and two friends who offered objective feedback. Drinking occasionally during the trip but maybe a beer every few hours. The trip ended nightmarishly introspective and while laying in my tent around 5 am until 9 am I shook violently and felt every chill through my bones while my mind raced and horror ensued. I came out my tent that morning shaking violently and felt weak. I had a sweet stink to me one I knew well,that of withdrawal from alcohol (or opiates similar stench). A new found friend who knew me inside and out essentially from the night previous said “ We bleached your skull last night zero!” While in GABA withdrawal sitting there shaking violently it hit me we actually may have actually done so. I was fearful of seizing though so I drank two beers followed by water. Until mid day I kept the alcohol regiment of a beer every three hours after the initial two followed by water intake light carbs and microdosing LSD and MDMA in the AM after the shakes subsided.Later in the evening having stopped my alcohol regiment another bigger dose of LSD was consumed (half dropper). I did this not expecting to trip but to keep what serotonin hadn’t been depleted and subsequently attempt to get at some sort of baseline and deep cleaning of harm done by Zoloft and years of anti psychotics meanwhile allowing nuero pathways to find anew. The result subjectively was not recreational on this dose. Deep chills and anxiety followed by another night of shaking and deep introspection. I awoke from restless inertia feeling oddly better. I wasn’t shaking, I didn’t have chills. I though I cup of coffee would be nice rather than a beer. I started the third day with a fattty breakfast and coffee followed by mass water consumption as well as consuming essential amino acids, tryptophan, and carbs. I slept like a baby for the first time in 3 years without a GABA agonist that night. Since, I have continued water consumption, supplementing with essential amino acids and tryptophan and I am eating everything in sight (prior having no appetite at all). It has now been 4 days since my last drink and two months since I stopped the Zoloft.  I have never felt more refreshed physically and mentally. Everything has changed for me.

4'11/108 lbs White/Hispanic

Started Sunday 7/15

Vagina/ lower pelvis, Utah

Medical history:

Partial thyroid removal 10/2012. I have made a few attempts to start medication but I keep having thyroid storms. Last one was Jan 2016 when I was prescribed 25mcg of Synthroid, and had started with the pills cut in half.

Transvaginal Hysterectomy (without larposcopic guidance) on 6/19. This was for a moderate uterine prolapse. I'm done having kids and the surgery was the best outcome possible for me.


 I also have low blood pressure, it averages around 85/50. Actually had to get cleared by a cardiologist to have the hysterectomy.

Took one extra strength Tylenol yesterday, otherwise no current medications.

***

My hysterectomy was text book perfect as far as the procedure went. My cervix, uterus and both fallopian tubes were removed without incident. I did not come out of surgery very well and ended up having to get an EKG about 6 hours after because my blood pressure kept going haywire and I kept having episodes of wanting to stop breathing, then I'd get really sad and then my pulse and oxygen levels would drop with my blood pressure going haywire. My discharge nurse told me that I should not have been given Percocet after waking up because my blood pressure was too low to handle it. Pain management at home was rotating through precription ibprofen and two over the counter extra strength Tylenol. I only had to do this for 8 days, and pain never went over a 4.

Prior to my hysterectomy, I was moderately active with a weight training regimen 1 to 2 times a week, and I keep my calorie intake to 1200 to 1400 a day. Despite being stationary I have not gained weight since my surgery; I've lost maybe a pound?

 Prior to my surgery, I saw a cardiologist for a semi unrelated issue. I have a two year history of ""anxiety"", but coupled with my blood pressure, my deafness, and the thyroid storms, and my medical history; the cardiologist thinks I have Long QT syndrome and more specifically, JLNS. I had to wear one of those heart monitors for three weeks starting on 6/11 and I had a stress test on 6/15 so I could be cleared for my hysterectomy. I follow up with him on 7/30. 

I'm prone to having ""anxiety attacks"" without rhyme or reason. 90% of them happen prior to needing to have a bowel movement; my blood pressure will spike up to around 115/90  and my heart rate will go over 120 prior to a visit to the toilet and will drop back to normal around 10 minutes later. The rest of the time it's either weird random things, like going out on a date with my husband or meeting friends or various other social situations.

I was told on 7/5 at my first follow up that I was good to go to start walking as long as I could tolerate it and going out and about, I was cleared to drive, and I was healing much faster than anticipated, I had stopped pain management early, bloating was gone in 4 days, I have followed instructions to the letter with no baths, insertions of any kind and kept to bedrest the first two weeks while not staying in bed for too long, ice pack rotating and never letting my bladder get overfull. I was actually given the go ahead to resume external genital stimulation, and have had around 8 or so orgasms without any incident, my last one was on 7/12.

So relevant to this situation on Sunday, I had a hair appointment for our anniversary date night to the opera with my husband and I was planning on leaving a little early to do last minute shopping, but I had gotten three blocks away from my house before I started dry heaving and had to turn back. Got home, and threw up and immediately felt better. Got my hair done, got home, got dressed, dropped our kids off at my in-laws and had a wonderful date with no issues. Super calm, relaxed. We got excellent parking and dinner was two minutes away from the theatre by foot.

Got to my in-laws house afterwards and I went to the bathroom and saw that I had spotted, I did not need to use the bathroom while out on the date. Didn't know what to make of it, especially because I had been experiencing really bad cramping the night before and earlier that day, my ovaries were left in so it was about that time for my period. 

I called my surgeons office the next day and spoke with the nurse. She said the cramping was due to ovulation (but that would have been 2 weeks ago and I have never gotten mittelschmerz), and because there's no uterus to cramp anymore, I was likely imagining things and it  was probably from walking too much and I popped stitches, even though the cramping was before, and actually stopped when I was walking around. I had forgotten to mention I had thrown up.

The nurse said not to worry about the bleeding unless it was bright red and if I'm also bleeding at a similar rate as to when I get my periods but they were always moderate anyway. It's currently dark brown and isn't letting up after going back on bedrest, it's slowly getting heavier but not at an alarming rate. Almost no pain at all either, no fever and my blood pressure and heart rate are stable. I'd call it moderate spotting.

I'm not sure at this point if I need to call the nurse back in the morning and mention I forgot to tell her I threw up or if it's even worth doing that, and if I also need to go see my GP to get put on anti nausea medication or something fast acting to keep my heart rate from going haywire and causing a vomiting episode. EDIT: I mention this because we have some upcoming events that may trigger ""anxiety attack"" episodes that could result in me throwing up again.",Long QT syndrome

Prior to my hysterectomy, I was moderately active with a weight training regimen 1 to 2 times a week, and I keep my calorie intake to 1200 to 1400 a day. Despite being stationary I have not gained weight since my surgery; I've lost maybe a pound?

 Prior to my surgery, I saw a cardiologist for a semi unrelated issue. I have a two year history of ""anxiety"", but coupled with my blood pressure, my deafness, and the thyroid storms, and my medical history; the cardiologist thinks I have Long QT syndrome and more specifically, JLNS. I had to wear one of those heart monitors for three weeks starting on 6/11 and I had a stress test on 6/15 so I could be cleared for my hysterectomy. I follow up with him on 7/30. 

I'm prone to having ""anxiety attacks"" without rhyme or reason. 90% of them happen prior to needing to have a bowel movement; my blood pressure will spike up to around 115/90  and my heart rate will go over 120 prior to a visit to the toilet and will drop back to normal around 10 minutes later. The rest of the time it's either weird random things, like going out on a date with my husband or meeting friends or various other social situations.

I was told on 7/5 at my first follow up that I was good to go to start walking as long as I could tolerate it and going out and about, I was cleared to drive, and I was healing much faster than anticipated, I had stopped pain management early, bloating was gone in 4 days, I have followed instructions to the letter with no baths, insertions of any kind and kept to bedrest the first two weeks while not staying in bed for too long, ice pack rotating and never letting my bladder get overfull. I was actually given the go ahead to resume external genital stimulation, and have had around 8 or so orgasms without any incident, my last one was on 7/12.

So relevant to this situation on Sunday, I had a hair appointment for our anniversary date night to the opera with my husband and I was planning on leaving a little early to do last minute shopping, but I had gotten three blocks away from my house before I started dry heaving and had to turn back. Got home, and threw up and immediately felt better. Got my hair done, got home, got dressed, dropped our kids off at my in-laws and had a wonderful date with no issues. Super calm, relaxed. We got excellent parking and dinner was two minutes away from the theatre by foot.

Got to my in-laws house afterwards and I went to the bathroom and saw that I had spotted, I did not need to use the bathroom while out on the date. Didn't know what to make of it, especially because I had been experiencing really bad cramping the night before and earlier that day, my ovaries were left in so it was about that time for my period. 

I called my surgeons office the next day and spoke with the nurse. She said the cramping was due to ovulation (but that would have been 2 weeks ago and I have never gotten mittelschmerz), and because there's no uterus to cramp anymore, I was likely imagining things and it  was probably from walking too much and I popped stitches, even though the cramping was before, and actually stopped when I was walking around. I had forgotten to mention I had thrown up.

The nurse said not to worry about the bleeding unless it was bright red and if I'm also bleeding at a similar rate as to when I get my periods but they were always moderate anyway. It's currently dark brown and isn't letting up after going back on bedrest, it's slowly getting heavier but not at an alarming rate. Almost no pain at all either, no fever and my blood pressure and heart rate are stable. I'd call it moderate spotting.

I'm not sure at this point if I need to call the nurse back in the morning and mention I forgot to tell her I threw up or if it's even worth doing that, and if I also need to go see my GP to get put on anti nausea medication or something fast acting to keep my heart rate from going haywire and causing a vomiting episode. EDIT: I mention this because we have some upcoming events that may trigger ""anxiety attack"" episodes that could result in me throwing up again.",anxiety attacks

Medical history:

Partial thyroid removal 10/2012. I have made a few attempts to start medication but I keep having thyroid storms. Last one was Jan 2016 when I was prescribed 25mcg of Synthroid, and had started with the pills cut in half.

Transvaginal Hysterectomy (without larposcopic guidance) on 6/19. This was for a moderate uterine prolapse. I'm done having kids and the surgery was the best outcome possible for me.


 I also have low blood pressure, it averages around 85/50. Actually had to get cleared by a cardiologist to have the hysterectomy.

Took one extra strength Tylenol yesterday, otherwise no current medications.

My hysterectomy was text book perfect as far as the procedure went. My cervix, uterus and both fallopian tubes were removed without incident. I did not come out of surgery very well and ended up having to get an EKG about 6 hours after because my blood pressure kept going haywire and I kept having episodes of wanting to stop breathing, then I'd get really sad and then my pulse and oxygen levels would drop with my blood pressure going haywire.

8z1yc4,"Hi all. I was diagnosed with Hashis in June 2016. At the time of diagnosis, my doctor said simply to take my thyroid medication (Synthroid) daily for treatment. No change in diet, etc. because “it’s an incurable disease” and my only option was to manage my symptoms with the medication dosage. 

Two years later, my symptoms have since spiraled out of control. The biggest issue is weight gain. I am a mid-twenties female and weighed 150 lbs. before diagnosis, plateaued around 165 lbs. shortly after and recently increased to 185 lbs. I eat fairly clean, but have a sweet tooth and don’t work out regularly. I am also experiencing fatigue, brain fog, a lowered sex drive (fun, I know) and very dry and brittle hair, skin and nails. 

I am in the process of moving across the country to begin law school in August, so I don’t have a lot of time to start seeing a new doctor. But, I can’t continue like this. Any recommendations? In doing my own research, it sounds like a gluten free diet or even AIP may be helpful. Has anyone seen success with this or similar at home methods?",weight gain

I've had very sore nipples for about 4-5 days. I had a period about 2 weeks ago. Last had sex about 3 weeks ago. I've been on nuvaring for about 15 years and don't usually have this. I've only experienced sore breasts when NOT on birth control and it would last a day or 2 before my period. I didn't think there was any way I could be pregnant due to the fact that I have taken my birth control as prescribed, however, I did do a pregnancy test this week and it came out negative.

Now it is 2 months later and I have had a lot of fatigue, I always am falling asleep, and can't stay up late cause I just pass out from being so tired. I'll wake up after 9 hours of sleep and want to take a nap 2 hours later.

My depression has gotten worse last 6 weeks, but no med changes since April. Changed jobs and was happy for awhile then crashed again.

I have little interest in things, when I find interest I get bored and decide to switch to something else, then realize it’s boring too. Been saying I’m sick to stay home from work. Memory has been terrible. I know certain things that might help but just thinking about them makes me feel exhausted. All my classic depression signs that show up, with the exception I don’t need to sleep a lot.

Talked to my therapist yesterday, she recommends me seeing my APRN again to go over meds early before school starts up again. She thinks I need to go back to a solid routine and doesn’t think my job is helping me since it’s very irregular sales job.

Medications:
- Lamictal 250mg at night
- Sertaline 100mg at night (for anxiety and OCD)
- Buproprion XL 150 mg morning
- Bupropion 75mg IR morning
- Trazadone 50mg sleep-aid

My theory is I’m in a mixed state, and the meds are making it weird, but my therapist obviously isn’t in the position to make any changes, my APRN is. I’m scheduling an appointment before school starts so I don’t destroy myself in school again.",depression

8zvq2g,"I have been struggling with the symptoms for about 3 years (or longer), though thinking it was depression/just life. At first, I was almost trying to collect the disorders (depression, bipolar) but when I was diagnosed with depression, I then felt ashamed and consigned to that fate. Eventually, I accepted it and tried to figure out what to do (medications, therapy, coping skills, exercise, support from family and friends).

Well none of the anti-depressants helped more than they harmed. I had some bad side effects (such as increased SI, severe dizziness and chest pain, anxiety which I didn't really have before, insomnia, lethargic, lack of interest in things, and one may have pushed me into hypomanic states more often with increased distress). But few of them actually noticeably helped the depression symptoms.

A couple therapist for my wife and I was actually the first person to suggest BP which I dismissed since a previous personal therapist said no and a doctor said no. But as I kept thinking about it, I actually could produce specific examples of hypomanic episodes such as starting intense creative projects and then crashing without warning during them, despite things going well. Anyways I won't go into all of that right now.

At that point, because it had been suggested and none of the other meds worked, I again almost became obsessed with trying to collect the diagnosis. I went to a rapid access psych consult (it was the only option available based on the circumstances) and the psychiatrist suggested my story fit bipolar 2 but didn't just want to give me a diagnosis, but made a few suggested changes to medications for my doctor.

He started me on lamictal which seemed to help at first, and then continued to help, and is still helping. That's such a weird experience considering I've always had very noticeable side effects and few positive results. At a follow up, he just refilled the lamictal and have advice for transitioning as we move. But he never specifically said I was diagnosed.

Earlier this week, I saw a resident for completely separate issue of abdominal pain and they casually asked if my only other medical condition was BP2. At first I didn't know how to answer, because I hadn't been sure I had the diagnosis. So I asked if she saw that listed on my chart or if she just assumed that was what the lamictal was for. She looked through the chart but couldn't find exactly where she saw that. I looked on the online portal which mentioned something like bipolar in remission, but then on another unrelated visit to the optometrist, the print out said bipolar 2.

So maybe it's just the way I found out about the diagnosis, or actually facing the diagnosis as a real thing instead of a maybe, but I almost feel like I can't mention it to anyone, even more so than depression. Before I got the diagnosis, I thought that bipolar might seem like more of a real thing than depression (obviously I know both can be very serious) in the sense that there is a specific pathology, whereas depression can literally be caused by anything. But like, it took me like a day to mention it to my wife and even then it was just a casual mention like ""this weird thing happened where the resident said this""

My point of all this is, what do you think? What should I do? How have you learned to cope with or accept your diagnosis? ",severe dizziness

Well none of the anti-depressants helped more than they harmed. I had some bad side effects (such as increased SI, severe dizziness and chest pain, anxiety which I didn't really have before, insomnia, lethargic, lack of interest in things, and one may have pushed me into hypomanic states more often with increased distress). But few of them actually noticeably helped the depression symptoms.

A couple therapist for my wife and I was actually the first person to suggest BP which I dismissed since a previous personal therapist said no and a doctor said no. But as I kept thinking about it, I actually could produce specific examples of hypomanic episodes such as starting intense creative projects and then crashing without warning during them, despite things going well. Anyways I won't go into all of that right now.

At that point, because it had been suggested and none of the other meds worked, I again almost became obsessed with trying to collect the diagnosis. I went to a rapid access psych consult (it was the only option available based on the circumstances) and the psychiatrist suggested my story fit bipolar 2 but didn't just want to give me a diagnosis, but made a few suggested changes to medications for my doctor.

He started me on lamictal which seemed to help at first, and then continued to help, and is still helping. That's such a weird experience considering I've always had very noticeable side effects and few positive results. At a follow up, he just refilled the lamictal and have advice for transitioning as we move. But he never specifically said I was diagnosed.

Earlier this week, I saw a resident for completely separate issue of abdominal pain and they casually asked if my only other medical condition was BP2. At first I didn't know how to answer, because I hadn't been sure I had the diagnosis. So I asked if she saw that listed on my chart or if she just assumed that was what the lamictal was for. She looked through the chart but couldn't find exactly where she saw that. I looked on the online portal which mentioned something like bipolar in remission, but then on another unrelated visit to the optometrist, the print out said bipolar 2.

So maybe it's just the way I found out about the diagnosis, or actually facing the diagnosis as a real thing instead of a maybe, but I almost feel like I can't mention it to anyone, even more so than depression. Before I got the diagnosis, I thought that bipolar might seem like more of a real thing than depression (obviously I know both can be very serious) in the sense that there is a specific pathology, whereas depression can literally be caused by anything. But like, it took me like a day to mention it to my wife and even then it was just a casual mention like ""this weird thing happened where the resident said this""

I keep having dreams that are torturing me with all of these things.

Last night I dreamt I was looking at my left knee (which I injured pretty badly about six months ago) and there was a little hole, maybe like a biggish blackhead. I squeezed it and a huge long version of the stuff that comes out of a blackhead came out, and I squeezed it again and it kept coming out. The hole was a little bigger. It didn’t hurt and no blood so I kept at it trying to get everything out. After a while I notice that the stuff coming out is now gray, then blue. It was freaking Walmart and grocery store plastic bags rolled up like rope! Why that was the part that grossed me out, I don’t know.

Why am I dreaming of things coming out of my body. Why am I dreaming of cysts at all. It’s been in my mind all day, almost taunting me.

My other dreams are just as bizarre lately too.",dreaming

I’m going to mention his concerns to my therapist this week and see what she thinks. I told him that once we have resolved some of our physical issues (finances, etc., not relationship issues), I may try to reduce my meds to just the Lamictal to see what effect it has.

8z5jha,"When I was about 32 I started getting these weird events which I later found out was TLE.  Likely caused by a bad concussion as a boy.

The ‘pre-turn auras’ were being sensitive to strong smells or flavours a week or less before the turns.

The turns start with a sudden odd feeling in the head, staring, and then nausea, face flushes and a strong citrus smell and taste and odd emotions. Quick onset and plateau and two minutes later perfectly fine again.

What my Neuro found odd was how regular it is. Every 4 weeks to the day or so I’d get a cluster of 4-10 turns over two days with the ‘pre-auras’ starting a week or so before.

The following week I’d get more ‘post-turn’ auras and turns but very diminished with little ‘blips’ lasting a second every 5 minutes or so all day. The auras are weird and the blip can be triggered by certain music, overcast light, strange images (like pictures), cool winds.

The lamictal didn’t seem to work and there was another I forget that I reacted badly to. I was at the point where I was accepting I just would this annoying thing for the rest of my life. My work desk bound me and I almost lost my licence. It took about two years of medication swaps and dose increases but I’m on 200 mg lamictal and 200 keppra a day and it’s been 5 months since a turn.

Has anyone else had similar experiences with TLE particularly the defined cycle and auras triggered by light etc?

8z3qcw,"I had my first-ever manic episode (included psychosis too!) a few months ago. Once mania subsided I fell into deep depression for months. I have been on Depakote, a little Abilify, and increasing amounts of Lamictal, which did nothing for the depression. 

This week, my doctor finally prescribed me some Wellbutrin for depression. I'm really hoping this will be the thing that makes me able to get off the couch, work, enjoy life, use my brain again. 

Does anyone have any (hopefully positive) experiences with Wellbutrin & a similar situation?

Thanks everyone. ",manic episode

8yzmra,"I’ve been on antidepressants since October (Zoloft since March). I was diagnosed with Bipolar II a couple months ago but wasn’t able to see a pdoc until 3 weeks ago. She upped my Zoloft (for anxiety) and started me on Lamictal. I’m at 100 mg now, and I feel like a zombie now. That might be an exaggeration.. I don’t know. It’s not as bad as dissociation, but it’s sort of similar in that I feel nothing. I feel like I want to go get drunk or try drugs or have sex with strangers or something to make myself feel again.

I miss my hypomanic episodes so much right now. I kind of even miss my depression because even then I was feeling SOMETHING. But I’d much rather have the hypomania than depression if I’m choosing.

I see the pdoc again in 10 days. I’m definitely going to speak with her about my concerns. I was just wondering if anyone could tell me: What is it supposed to feel like when your meds are working? This is something my pdoc can’t articulate considering she isn’t in our shoes.",feel like a zombie

8yxq1d,"I used to be very predictable in my pattern. If be manic for a week and depressed/dissociated for   4-5 weeks after that. It was predictable, I could feel the mood swings and be able to used mindfulness to over come it but now I've just been depressed for almost 6 months and really can't get out of it. 

I feel so alone  and I keep pushing everyone away, either reverting into antisocial behavior or getting angry and snappy to people I care about. I miss being the fun crazy party girl with a bunch of friends and an active social life, even if I did do some irrational stuff I felt alive.

I used to take zolof and lamictal and they worked really well but after getting into meditation and mindfulness training I stopped because I really hated by dependency on the medication (I really don't want to have to take them again, I was doing so well until some family incidents happened).

It's getting to the point where I just give up and want to end it all.  It's not like I feel much anyway.  I keep scratching at my skin but I don't want to leave any marks but I know it's not a good sign that I feel the urge to do it 

I'm only 19 but I'm just tired of feeling this way. I just don't really know what to do. (Sorry if this is all over the place, I'm a little bit of a mess rn)", dependency

8ysbr6,"TD;LR:- Prescribed Klonopin yesterday, worried about sedation. No free day in sight to experiment with it, nervous about the side effects. Anyone else take this drug?

Hi friends. So yesterday I went to my doctor in a mixed sorta weird hypomanic / dysphoric state. I told him I was, above all else, irritable and acting hostile towards people at home and generally feeling on edge constantly. My doc commented that he felt I was indeed in a mixed state- my first real one of these ever (thanks bipolar, love you as always). We looked into some meds options. He suggested depakote- I said no due the fact that it would be the 3rd mood stabiliser I'm on after lithium and lamictal, so that was a no. He then suggested Abilify, which was a no because I got bad akathisia from it and I'm told it causes weight gain. Wellbutrin was also off the table as that would most definitely make me more manic/mixed, so the only thing left was Klonopin. 

He's written me up for 0.5mg twice daily. My doc said he wants me to take it regularly, twice daily, and see how I go. See the thing is, I work in psychiatric care and nearly all of my patients are on this drug. The all seem so doe eyed and sedated by it, though they are all on 2-4mg four times daily so I'm aware I may not be the same. 

My schedule is jam-packed at the moment with college placement, work commitments and take care of my kids while my ex works. I want to have a free day to take one of the .5mg tablets to see what it does- I don't want to have a situation where I take one for the first time and have to bail out of work due to being too sedated. My job carries a lot of responsibility and I work with psychiatric patients, so there is no scope for me to be 'not with it' during a shift. 

Does anyone here take this medication? What are your experiences of it and what do you take it for? Big question- what kind of sedation am I expecting? Are there any other side effects I should be aware of?

Edit:- thanks so much all of you for your responses. I don't have time to reply to all of them but you're all really kind. Thank you!",akathisia

8yp4gp,"Hello, 

I am a 23 year old white female. 5'2"" and 215lbs (please don't be mean about my weight). Nonsmoker (weed/cigarettes). Diagnosed as bipolar 2. Currently on lithium, lamictal, sertraline, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism induced by lithium, bcp, trazodone and hydroxyzine/lorazepam prn. Started lithium mid April and started levothyroxine at the end of May.

For approx 7-8 weeks I have begun to have migraines/headaches. I have had migraines before now, but not as frequent. I also experience dizziness (but not the room spinning) and lightheadedness. I have extreme fatigue (this has been going on for a long time, but has increased lately). 

I went to see my PCP on July 3rd. She ordered an MRI, as I had difficulty with walking heel to toe as well as flipping my hand over on my left side.

On the morning of July 4th, I woke up and was extremely unsteady. I would almost fall over just from walking normally. I went to urgent care as it was really hot out and I didn't know if I was just dehydrated. Upon exam at urgent care, I guess I had some abnormal signs in the neurology exam (when asked to stand with my eyes closed and my arms out in front of me, I almost immediately began to fall over). They did a CT which came back normal. They also checked my lithium level as well as my kidney function, all which came back normal. They tested for benign positional vertigo and that was ruled out. I was sent to the ER by urgent care as they were concerned about my neuro exam.

At the ER, my neuro exam had worsened slightly (more unsteady, still dizzy). They gave me meclizine (which makes me more dizzy, even at a half dose) and Reglan (which caused agitation) as well as fluids. They sent me home and told me to f/u with PCP. 

I haven't felt any better. MRI w/o contrast was done last night, it was completely normal. I see neurology on Thursday but I don't know what's going on and it's freaking me out.

Additionally, I feel like my left side is ""weird"" when I walk. I tend to fall to the left side. Headaches are all over my head, sometimes on one side and sometimes centralized. I've also had (somewhat rare, but newer) tingling and weird feelings in my hands. Over the last 5 years I've gained 100lbs. I've also had an increasingly hard time concentrating/interpreting sound/words over the last few years. I consistently switch numbers around (i.e. 18 rather than 81). I don't know if any of this is connected. I might just be freaking myself out but I wanted to know if anyone had any ideas before I see neurology.

Thank you!",migraines

They did a CT which came back normal. They also checked my lithium level as well as my kidney function, all which came back normal. They tested for benign positional vertigo and that was ruled out. I was sent to the ER by urgent care as they were concerned about my neuro exam.

At the ER, my neuro exam had worsened slightly (more unsteady, still dizzy). They gave me meclizine (which makes me more dizzy, even at a half dose) and Reglan (which caused agitation) as well as fluids. They sent me home and told me to f/u with PCP. 

I haven't felt any better. MRI w/o contrast was done last night, it was completely normal. I see neurology on Thursday but I don't know what's going on and it's freaking me out.

Additionally, I feel like my left side is ""weird"" when I walk. I tend to fall to the left side. Headaches are all over my head, sometimes on one side and sometimes centralized. I've also had (somewhat rare, but newer) tingling and weird feelings in my hands. Over the last 5 years I've gained 100lbs. I've also had an increasingly hard time concentrating/interpreting sound/words over the last few years. I consistently switch numbers around (i.e. 18 rather than 81). I don't know if any of this is connected. I might just be freaking myself out but I wanted to know if anyone had any ideas before I see neurology.

8xv3ql,"First off, I love reading everybody’s posts, I relate so much sometime and it helps me get through the lows. 

Today was the worst of days for me. I was diagnosed within the last year with bipolar and I have been trying to work through it and understand it day by day. I’ve been trialing meds over this period and finally have started to find something that works. My psychologist wants to start low dose and build up as not to overdose me, which is all fine and dandy, but at this point I just want to feel normal. I’m on lamictal and it is definitely helping me not have my highs, but it’s settling me in my lows. My psychologist is about to put me on anti depressants to help, but my anxiety is through the roof that it won’t work fast enough. 

Today just happened to be one of those days that if it can go wrong, it did. I’m at wits end and just feel like all is lost. I don’t feel totally suicidal, but I’m worried I’m going to get there if something good doesn’t happen on my life soon. 

I’ve refrained from posting for awhile as I’m just not that kind of person to put my struggles on others, but this community has helped me without giving advice and honestly venting is making it a bit less stressful. 

Has anybody been there where nothing seems to go right and nothing looks good on the horizon? How do you cope and pull yourself out of the abyss that is depression?",anxiety

8zwaqj,"So, I did a search, and found kind of limited answers, so thought I'd just post.  I have clinical depression, been on Venlafaxine ER for the better part of 15 years now.  I also have some other health concerns, such as high BP, high cholesterol, that i'm interested in hopefully helping/controlling with CBD.  I recently came off of my statin and BP meds with my Dr's blessing, and BP is now elevated again, and I will find out soon what my cholesterol looks like.  I'm 38 years old... I don't want to be taking a handfull of damn pills everyday!  So, that has kind of pushed me over the edge to finally try CBD.

Now that I've decided to go this route, i'd like to get off of any meds possible, including Venlafaxine.  Taking it for as long as I have, I am a pro at tapering off, and have done it twice (for pregnancies). I actually did ok, until post-partum hit me hard, and I went back on.  The fact that I did ok for a while without meds makes me hopeful that I may be able to manage it with CBD alone.

And just as a note, I will most definitely talk to my doctors as well.  But sometimes, advice from people with personal experience is just as important!

So my questions: 

1. I would think slowly tapering off the Velnafaxine, and slowly increasing the CBD would be the way to go.  Does anyone have experience they could share on what that was like? Did it help with the god aweful withdrawl effects (brain zaps, brain fog, fatigue, etc)?

2. I am specifically looking into CBDistillery tinctures to start.  As you know, there are many different strengths available.  I am leaning towards the 500mg 15mL tincture - thinking i'd start with a half dropper full, or roughly 16mg of CBD, and go from there.  Opinions? Experiences?  Is that too high/low a starting dose?  I realize everyone is different, but all I can seem to find is 'start low and work your way up'.  Well, what is 'low'?!

3. I'm considering also ordering one of their disposable vape pens to try.  But, I'm very unclear on dosing, number of uses, battery life, etc.  Can someone provide any clarity on that?

Sorry this is so long.  I am excited to give this a try - and hopeful that all of the benefits I've read about are true.  If so, I know sooo many people that could benefit from this.  

Thanks!",withdrawl

8yrhpz,"The similarities are astounding, not just in effects but in the path they took/are taking in society. 

Alprazolam (Xanax):
-Synthesized in 1981. It’s use seems to be peaking now, slightly over 20 years later. 
-Used almost as much recreationally as medicinally (if not more so). 
-Sedative, Hypnotic, Anxiolytic, General CNS Depressant
-Extremely good at its job as an anxiolytic, but simply too psychoactive and addictive to be allowed to seep into the masses. 
-Used for MENTAL issues (anxiety/insomnia) meaning that there is no way a doctor can tell if you really need it. 

Methaqualone (Quaalude):
-Synthesized in 1951. It’s use peaked 20 years later, throughout the 70s. 
-Used almost as much recreationally as medicinally at its peak (if not more so). 
-Sedative, Hypnotic, General CNS Depressant
-Extremely good at its job as a sedative, but simply too psychoactive and addictive to be allowed to seep into the masses. 
-Used for MENTAL issues (insomnia) meaning that there is no way a doctor can tell if you really need it.  (Though, to be fair, insomnia is not always mental, just most of the time)

—

At this point, it’s a question of when, not if. You can see the similarities, and, even more intriguingly, the utter lack of difference. Quaaludes were Schedule 1’d in 1985, about 10 years after their use peaked. I believe that, even then, the U.S. knew that outlawing it wouldn’t stop people from using it. I think they knew the real idea behind it was cutting off the supply. And sure enough, no matter how many kitchen chemists cooked and clandestine labs produced, here we are, completely out. 

A point you might be making to yourself right now is: “So why aren’t opioids banned?” Good question, simple answer. Opioids are not expendable. There are no other options besides opioids. Sure you have NSAIDs and Steroidal drugs but the fact is that for REAL pain relief, opioids can’t be matched or even competed with. Though Marijuana is an exception to this, it was also Schedule 1’d, leaving opiates as simply and sadly the only option. Like Quaaludes, Xanax is the best at what it does, sure. But also like Quaaludes, it has replacements. Buspirone, Venlafaxine, and Dumatril all work wonders for anxiety and panic. Even SSRIs can work for less serious cases. Of course, Benzodiazepines are the best at what they do, there’s no questioning that. And, to be completely honest, Quaaludes had a close 2nd, much closer than Dumatril and Xanax. That would be barbiturates. But the fact is, there IS a 2nd for Xanax. There was a 2nd for Quaaludes, and there was no 2nd for opiates or amphetamines (except phenidates, which turned out to be just as bad) which were Schedule 2’d rather than 1’d so that production could continue, but on thin ice. As long as there is a working alternative, the DEA will see no need for Benzodiazepines to continue being produced. And with the absolute fuckfest that the government is calling the “war on drugs” I can’t imagine that letting these drugs flood the streets right under their noses can be allowed to happen much longer. I predict a Schedule II or I in the near future for Xanax and other Benzodiazepines. 

This all was just a conclusion I came to after a few hours of research. I’d be happy to hear your thoughts and arguments on the topic. 

PS: I don’t wish for Benzodiazepines to be Schedule 1’d, or scheduled at all for that matter. I personally am in the legalize-it-all group. 

Edit: WOW I was whacked. So turns out one of my arguments is completely invalid as I forgot that 1981 was 40 years ago not 20. Time fucking flies man..",addictive 
8xwnsu,Hi folks - my psychiatric nurse practitioner just added the extended release version of guanfacine to my meds list (I also take venlafaxine for anxiety and straterra for ADHD). Has anyone else taken it and what was it most helpful for? My hope is for my rampantly difficult emotional sensitivity and impulsivity. The side effect I'm most concerned about is constipation since I'm already having that side effect with Straterra. I also have normal blood pressure so there's some risk of my blood pressure dropping too low. Thanks for your feedback!,constipation 
8zpdid,"Seriously, I'm fighting with my body doing all kinds of stupid shit. I'm on Tysabri, and I'm guessing none of this is like actual relapses but fuck me are all these symptoms annoying. My eyelids right now are twitching like crazy, and this is fairly common for me... and extremely annoying. I'm also smelling something that smells like sulfur, which may or may not be something in my house or I'm just having seizures. No idea, really... I dealt with some weird feeling like a jolt through my brain that lasted 5-10 seconds a week or so ago and that really messed with me. But I'm not diagnosed with epilepsy so \o/. It's always something, and it's super frustrating! 

Sorry for the little venting post. Keeping this shit to myself so I don't burden others with it is what I do 99% of the time. I feel bad every time I mention something bad going on with me.

8yzqh9,"Hey all, I""m not exactly sure if this is the right place to come, because he has not been properly diagnosed (when he is taken to psychiatric hospitals/ has been under involuntary psychiatric ward he refuses to talk to psychiatrists, but we believe it is in some range of schizo-affective to bipolar.) Anyways, he has been prescribed many different medicines, but the only one he actually took after being prescribed was Zyprexa. We somehow got him to take him to take it for around 7 weeks most nights begging for an hour or two before he would take it, and he has been at 30mg for that period. Now he has stopped for a few days and we think he plans on stopping cold turkey because Zyprexa has permanently affected him by stopping his stomach from functioning, emotional numbness, he says he is infertile now. In general, I need tips to stop him from in fact stopping cold turkey. With such a high dosage (30mg) and a refusal to see any doctors how can we communicate that he should be trying to wean off somehow instead of stopping altogether completely.

I just went from thinking I had anxiety for and taking antidepressants for several years to being diagnosed with bipolar and taking lithium in a mental hospital. I was also prescribed  Seroquel, but I never thought it was really helping and decreased my dosage to half a pill at night, because otherwise I seemed to have sleep trouble. (I know that decreasing my dosage without consulting a psychiatrist is frowned upon). I saw a psychiatrist on Monday for the first time since leaving the hospital and was prescribed 5mg of Zyprexa. 

Can anyone share their experience with that drug here? My big fear is becoming dependent and being unable to go off it later. Any first hand knowledge people and share would help greatly.",sleep trouble

I was also prescribed  Seroquel, but I never thought it was really helping and decreased my dosage to half a pill at night, because otherwise I seemed to have sleep trouble. (I know that decreasing my dosage without consulting a psychiatrist is frowned upon). I saw a psychiatrist on Monday for the first time since leaving the hospital and was prescribed 5mg of Zyprexa. 

Can anyone share their experience with that drug here? My big fear is becoming dependent and being unable to go off it later. Any first hand knowledge people and share would help greatly.",dependent
8y80b6,"After being forced to the psych hospital by my college campus psych doctor I was told I have an undetermined personality disorder possibly schizophrenia. I do not have visual hallucinations I just get quite paranoid and get delusional. 

They swapped my meds a couple times seroquil -> zyprexa but I always felt like a shell of a person. In my history of taking antidepressants I always just feel less alive. So I usually just stop my medication because it is so awful. But my paranoia is starting to get really bad, I am so on edge all the time it is exhausting, I want to scream. But I also dont want to feel like total shit for the medicine. 

I am scared. Any advice?",paranoia
8y0pfb,So I’m at the doctor and it looks like I’ve gained 14 or so pounds since May 7th. But that’s impossible. Here’s why: I began dieting again sometime in late May/early June and only started screwing up the diet again last week. 1 month isn’t enough time to put on all that weight when I haven’t been eating THAT bad. It makes no sense. Except I started the Zyprexa June 8th and that’s the only thing that can explain this astronomical weight gain as I’ve almost never gained THIS much in a month based on my weight records. However I’m only at 2.5 mg but medication works quick for me so idk if it did but it’s the only thing that can explain it....... anyone had something similar happen? ,weight gain

I'm stressed and suffering tonight. Waiting for the zyprexa to take effect. I'm concerned about work tomorrow but I think it will be a relief to get solid sleep tonight again.

My doctor is thinking about having me try clozapine soon, which scares me. It could be a wonder drug but the side effect of white blood cell suppression worries me. It isn't common but it can be deadly. I'd get weekly blood tests.

I'm scared of having another breakdown and losing my job. I'm afraid that people will find out that I have a psychotic disorder and my career will be over. I'm scared of having everyone find out. I wish they already knew and it was OK.

It really bothers me to have to have this big secret and still have all the expectations of a normal person on me. I feel like I'm barely hanging on.

No risk of suicide, fwiw. But pray for my wife too, please. She has anxiety and depression and this can't be easy on her either.

I think I'll be okay but I could really use the prayers. Thanks, family!

Social activity has always been hard. It really seems to overly effect me when made fun of or rejected (even simply vying for attention). I developed the clamshell defense. ""I may be fat but you literally know nothing else about me."" If the worst insult youve got is fatass, thats tolerable.

I got lasik and developed post lasik ectasia. I cant afford the expensive specialized contacts. I got my stomach removed and lost little weight. I drank ayahuasca and had the most concentrated period of bad in my life, but no benefits. It only showed me things that made me weirder and it decreased the pool of people I can relate with. I have sleep apnea and I havent been able to tolerate the treatment. 

I think my self awareness is very high, but its actually low. I figure these things out with time and I think ""this is the one. I just gotta fix that then working on everything else will be easier."" But it never was.

I've taken straterra, adderall, concerta, welbutrin, zoloft, viibryd, all the common supplements, intranasal insulin, ashwagandha. All of these over the last 7 years whenever i build up the energy to try something else. Im going to try modafinil and guanfacine soon.

There is no place in this world for an adult who can not tolerate boredom. His only options are burdening his family or suicide. I worked probably 2.5 years since i graduated. I have had 4 jobs. I get one and the novelty/new things keep the unpleasantness at a 5 or 6/10. Then i have done everything new and it slowly works up to a 10 at which point i debate suicide instead of telling my keepers that i quit again.

I have had much professional help. I simply am incompatible with this medical system or i am unhelpable or the doctors here are trash. Medicine helps me stay on the road for awhile but I always crash. I was doing everything right at one point, I would run 3 miles on my lunch break around the store I worked at. I ate well. I was medicated. I was about 270 lbs and able to run 5 miles in 50 minutes without giving everything i had. But then I just couldnt do it anymore. I enjoy running. But I cant work 8 hours 5 days a week. The sensations build up and become too unpleasant quickly. I sneak out the back and never talk to anyone from there again

I take risks when I am desperate. I get drastic surgeries and try weird drugs. Hopefully the unsatisfactoriness forces me to kill myself soon. I dont like life

Tldr;I experience boredom more harshly than others or I lack the skills that everyone else uses to dissipate boredom. I have tried a lot of things. It has had serious consequences on the path of my life and it will preferably soon end it. Any advice?",ectasia

July 8, 2013. The day that would change my life forever.

But first, let’s rewind a bit…

A few weeks earlier, I had just gotten out of the hospital for my 4th Crohn’s flare in 2 years. The medication I was currently on, Humira, seemed to be doing the trick (after its 3 predecessors failed to work) as it was 15 months since my last hospitalization. So, you can imagine my surprise & devastation when I was told I was having a severe flare, needed hospitalization, and had to explore yet another medication.

Upon leaving the hospital, I knew I had to do something to change this vicious cycle of being sick and hospitalized.

I sought the help of a nutritionist who came highly recommended and she said to me during our first call that I had to go gluten free. As in, it was a life-or-death situation and this is what I HAD to do.

Turns out, it was not necessarily “life-or-death” however it was happiness vs. misery, staying in a hotel on vacation vs. staying in a hospital, going out with friends vs. laying on the couch at home, and barely making it through the day vs. thriving in my life.

Of course, I chose the latter of all of those decisions and decided that I would go cold turkey and give up gluten if it meant that I got my life and health back…and I could not be happier that I did.

I want to point out that giving up gluten was not a choice I made in order to lose weight, or to join a “fad”. It was to be healthier overall, which I was sure to share with my friends and loved ones so that they were supportive in my efforts, as they only wanted the best for me.

As I navigated my new lifestyle — yes, that is what it was; not a diet, a lifestyle — I realized I had to make many changes to habits I had in place in order to be successful.

I had to take control.

I could no longer grab a bagel breakfast sandwich on the way to work, and eating wherever others suggested wasn’t always an option. I had to start making my own meals, packing my own breakfast, and learn how to do all of this while juggling a busy schedule.

That in itself was scary, and was a huge learning curve.

I began the habit of showing up 20 minutes before my lunch meetings so that I could talk to the waiter and/or chef about what I could and couldn’t eat on the menu. When I went out with friends, I got in the habit of ordering my own appetizer since I couldn’t always share what the table ordered. Going on dates meant being assertive and picking the restaurant rather than saying “whatever you want”(which was well received by my would-be-future husband). And, going to the beach for the weekend with my friends meant packing a bunch of my own food, and drinks since beer was now off limits.

This is just a small example of new habits I had to adapt to in order to live the life I wanted. Healthy, happy, thriving, energetic, and most importantly not sick.

5 years later I am exactly where I have always wanted to be. I am healthy, happy, thriving, energetic (most days) and have been in remission with my Crohn’s Disease since August 2016.

All of these habit changes were worth it.

So, the point of my whole story is that once you master a new habit and lifestyle change is when you truly see a change in your life. It is so much more than just saying “eat this and not that” — it is truly committing to a pattern that works for you.

Which is why I became a Health Coach. I took all that I had gone through in developing a healthy lifestyle for myself and combined it with what I learned through my training and now offer it to clients to help them create those lifestyle changes that lead to their own life-changing outcomes.

Being healthy is way more than dieting and killing yourself at the gym. It is implementing habits and lifestyle changes that fit into your routine which help you become the person you want to become. I am now in the best shape — emotionally and physically — than I have ever been, and with a few simple habit changes, you can be, too!",flare

Been having this full burning in my perineum for the last few days or so.

I’m only drinking water and o don’t feel dehydrated. I’m unsure if it’s an STD. Last time I had sex was a few weeks ago and I imagine I’d be having issues before now. I’m also unsure if it has to do with my pelvic floor muscles. When I poop I often urinate at the same time. I don’t think my muscles are acting properly. I also have to strain sometimes it go and that causes semen to leak out sometimes. It’s very strange. It could all be related but I’m not sure. I just want to make sure I don’t have some kind of infection brewing. Last time I had something like this I went to the urgent care and paid like $100 for a urine sample and for them to just tell me I had “prostatitis” and gave me antibiotics. I didn’t take them and the problem subsided within a couple days after that. Just don’t want to repeat that again.",cloudy urine

8ysl1r,"Is it normal that my heart rate doesn't drop low when I'm in a recovery interval? When I'm done with a 20min block at intesity, I get a 10min rest period.

The recovery interval has no set wattage to it, the trainer gives no resistance (spinning the legs). Shoudn't my HR be dropping closer to my rest HR (68)?

I recently got a new job that has health insurance that I can afford (my last job had an oop that was $10k... yikes) Anyhow, I just realized that Stelara for Crohn's is not a covered medication on my new insurance. I just signed up for the Janssen assistance, however, they only assist you up to $20k a year. So I guess I'm asking for some advice on what to do. I'd rather not switch medications because I'm only recently on Stelara and I love it. I was on Humira for about two years and was doing wonderfully when out of the blue it caused psoriasis in my hair and arthritis in literally every joint in my body, from jaw to toes. It also caused some severe swelling in my tendons along my joints, and some mild swelling in my lips and throat (it was a blast let me tell ya.) I also can't go see my doctor about it because she doesn't accept my insurance! Surprise!

I'm currently looking up new doctors but I will admit I am a bit panicked.

tl;dr: have you ever experienced a change of insurance that threw you for a complete loop and left you without a way to pay for your meds or see your doctor and if so please share some advice with a fellow crohnie.",psoriasis

I also can't go see my doctor about it because she doesn't accept my insurance! Surprise!

I'm currently looking up new doctors but I will admit I am a bit panicked.

tl;dr: have you ever experienced a change of insurance that threw you for a complete loop and left you without a way to pay for your meds or see your doctor and if so please share some advice with a fellow crohnie.",swelling in my lips
8yfkko,"Hi everyone,

I've been struggling with Psoriasis for about 12 years with a diagnosis when I was about twenty. It started out on my scalp and spread to nearly my entire head, legs, and back.  Each 6 months to a year the doctor would elevate the level of treatment from creams / injections to methotrexate and otezla. Nothing made me more nauses and sick than Otezla.

The injections into inflamed areas would only give minor relief for a week or two.

I heard about a new drug about 11 months ago called Cosentryx. I asked my doctor who is a saint to look into it and he decided to give it a shot after doing research into the drug.  It's incredibly expensive, but if you have insurance, the company will send it to you for free for two years and will work with your doctor to get it authorized.

It comes in  an iced package that you inject yourself once a month.  By about my 4th month I had DRAMATIC remission of my Psoriasis. I honestly feel like the medication was a god send.  I'm 99&#37; clear and occasionally get itchy in spots. I had NO idea that I could actually get my psoriasis into near full remission.  After trying every drug on the market (except humira), this was the cure.

The only downside is that you have to take it every month. You can't stop. Also, it is an insanely expensive drug. I had to appeal my insurance carrier to the highest levels after getting repeated noncerts. I was only able to have it approved as my doctor kept years of very detailed notes on the various treatments I had undergone which he used to convince the ins. company to authorize it.

Anyways, I wish you all the best and if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask.",nauses

8yb5vl,"Do not fear an Ostomy, when and if that time comes accept and embrace the new lease on life. (Especially if you have UC)

My daughter's quick story. Just about 2 years ago at 15 my daughter got her first flare was hospitalized and diagnosed with UC. Over the last two years she has been on prednisone for all but 3 months. And those months (2 the first time and 1 the second), saw her right back into Severe Pancolitis despite being on Humira the first time and Remicade the second. So after her last flare and hospital stay she researched and decided that she wanted off prednisone and to get an ileostomy. The prednisone has slowly been killing her. She hasn't had fiber in 2 years. And all other biologics she would have to wait until she 18 to be able to take.

We saw the surgeon on June 18th and scheduled surgery for July 9th. Her surgery went great. Her colon was still inflamed despite prednisone and Remicade since January. They did it completely laproscopic. Her first day was painful as the surgeon wanted her not to use opioids because they slow healing. So heavy duty ibuprofen, neurontin and tramidol were what she used. After the first 12 hours her pain went from a 10 to a 4 and she was sitting up on her own. Next day she was up and walking around even down to the lobby. She started a completely unrestricted diet less than 24 after surgery. She ate her first Sun Chip in 2 years and was in heaven.

She got to come home yesterday, just over 48 hours after surgery. She loves her stoma and new lease on life she has. She can look forward to college and life again. She can do road trips. She can do the things her UC has kept her from for 2 years. She can eat whatever she wants (in moderation) and take ibuprofen again.

She hasn't been this happy in years. Please don't fear an ostomy as it can give you your life back. ",flare

8y4575," How is it that respiratory medicines work? If your a respiratory therapist like me, a quick review is always helpful. If you're a patient, it might be neat to learn how the medicines you have in your medicine cabinet work. So, here is a quick review. Today's focus will be on beta-adrenergic medicine like albuterol and anticholinergic medicine like Spiriva.  


For starters, these types of medicines have some impact on the autonomic nervous system.  


**What is the autonomic nervous (ANS) system?** It's the system that contains all the nerves, neurons, and neurotransmitters that control all your inner organs, including your heart, blood vessels, and lungs.  
It also controls other organs, but for our purposes, we'll limit our discussion to these three.  


The ANS responds to your internal and external environment by releasing certain chemicals (we'll get to these in a moment) that bind to receptor sites (we'll get to these in a moment too) on specific organs to tell them what to do. It contains two parts.  


1. **Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)**. It stimulates your organs to respond to emergency situations. It essentially stimulates what is often referred to as the ""flight or fight"" response. 
2. **Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS)**. It inhibits (or shuts off) the SNS response. It returns your body systems back to normal status and controls these organs during normal, ordinary circumstances. 

Here are some of the bodily responses the ANS controls that we need to be concerned with. 

* **Blood Pressure**. 
   * SNS: Narrows blood vessels to speed up the flow of blood to increase blood pressure
   * PNS: Dilates blood vessels to slow the flow of blood to decrease blood pressure. 
* **Heart Rate**.
   * SNS: Speeds up the rate and force to pump blood through narrowed vessels.
   * PNS: Slows it down as less pressure is needed to pump blood through dilated vessels.
* **Airways**:
   * SNS: Dilates airways to make breathing free and easy.
   * PNS: Constricts Airways to return them to normal. 

Now we must delve into how the SNS affects these responses. To begin with, the ANS involves nerve cells that secrete neurotransmitters. There are two types of nerve cells, each of which secretes a neurotransmitter. 

1. **Adrenergic**. These are nerve cells that secrete the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which stimulates an SNS response and inhibits a PNS response. 
2. **Cholinergic**. These are nerve cells that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which stimulates a PNS response and inhibits the SNS response. 

Neurotransmitters are transmitted through neurons and are attracted to certain receptors that are attached to certain cells in specific organs. The receptors include...

1. **Adrenergic receptors**. These are receptors that norepinephrine is attracted to. Another neurotransmitter called epinephrine (adrenaline) is also attracted to them. Neurotransmitters attracted to them are called catecholamines. When a catecholamine binds to an adrenergic receptor, it stimulates some SNS response. 
2. **Cholinergic receptors**. These are receptors that acetylcholine is attracted to. When acetylcholine binds to a cholinergic receptor, it stimulates some PNS response. 

**There are two groups of adrenergic receptors**. 

* **a (Alpha)**. 
   * **a-1-Adrenergic Receptors**. They line blood vessels and when stimulated by catecholamines this causes vasoconstriction.  
* **ß (Beta) Receptors**. 
   * **ß-1 Adrenergic Receptors**. They line heart muscle tissue and are attracted to catecholamines, which cause an increase in rate and force of the heart to increase cardiac output. This is needed to create the needed pressure to pump blood through narrowed arteries. The purpose of these combined effects is to assure tissues receive adequate oxygenation during a stressful event. 
   * **ß-2 Adrenergic Receptors**. They line airway smooth muscles (from the trachea to terminal bronchioles). They are attracted to catecholamines, which cause bronchodilation to open airways. 

**Sympathomimetic Medicine**. These are medicines that are attracted to adrenergic receptors. They mimic catecholamine and include.

* S**hort-Acting Beta Agonists (SABA)**. These are medicines that are attracted to B2 receptors to relax bronchiolar smooth muscles to dilate (open) airways within minutes and only last 4-8 hours. They are non-specific to B1 and B2 receptors, and therefore offer negligible side effects. These include epinephrine (Adrenaline), albuterol (Ventolin, ProAir, Proventil), and levalbuterol (Xopenex). Some SABAs that are no longer used include Isoproterenol (isoprenaline), terbutaline, ephedrine ([Ma-huang](http://asthmahistory.blogspot.com/2014/11/2838-chinese-discover-worlds-best.html)), and Metaproterenol (Alupent). These are also referred to as rescue medicine because they open airways relatively fast. As a general rule, most experts recommend all asthmatics and COPD patients have it nearby at all times. Epinephrine has the greatest risk for stimulating B1, B2, and A1 receptors and offering side effects. The other ones currently on the market have minimal effect on B1 receptors, although some studies show that they can cause an increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and EKG changes in some individuals (although this is rare, it should be considered). The recommended dose of albuterol is 2 puffs every 4-6 ours. Studies seem to suggest that the medicine is safe for use in emergencies even at high doses, although the chronic use of high doses (using more than 6 times a day) may cause a decrease in beta 2 adrenergic receptors. This may cause tachyphylaxis, resulting in the need for even higher doses just to obtain minimal results. Excessive use of albuterol is a clear indicator of the need to seek medical attention and for physicians to consider asthma controller medicines or a step-up treatment approach for those already using controller medicines. While initial studies showed levalbuterol to offer fewer side effects to albuterol, more recent studies show it can produce the same side effects, and is therefore not superior to but equal to albuterol in as a bronchodilator, although it costs more due to a current patent. SABA's may also lower potassium. To learn more check out our post, ""[How Albuterol Lowers Potassium](http://respiratorytherapycave.blogspot.com/search?q=potassium).""
* **Long-Acting Beta Agonists (LABA)**. These are beta agonists that last 12-24 hours. These include salmeterol and formoterol. These are rarely given alone for the treatment of asthma, although they remain viable options for asthma and COPD. For asthma, they are usually included in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid in inhalers like Advair, Symbicort, Dulera, and Breo. These are generally used as asthma controller or preventive medicine, and they must be taken every day to truly be effective. For COPD, they are considered a top-line option, although some studies seem to indicate that Spiriva alone offers improved lung function and reduction in the feeling of shortness of breath compared with LABA's alone. Formoterol in Symbicort and Dulera has a rapid onset and can open airways as fast as a SABA. Serevent in Advair opens airways in about 15 minutes. 

**There are two groups of cholinergic receptors**. 

* **Muscarinic Receptors**. Acetylcholine is attracted to them. When acetylcholine binds to them, this causes airways to narrow and mucus secretion to increase. 
* **Nicotine**. I won't even go here. This is a discussion for another day. 

**Anticholinergic/ Muscarinic Medicine**. These are medicines that are attracted to Muscarinic Receptors and thereby bind to them to prevent acetylcholine from binding to them. They are called anticholinergics because they block their effects by preventing them from binding to muscarinic receptors. Cholinergic stimulation has a primary effect on COPD, so anticholinergics are a top-line treatment for COPD. Studies seem to show that anticholinergics are equal in their bronchodilation effect for a patient with COPD compared to b2 agonists, and may even have a superior bronchodilation effect. Cholinergic stimulation has a secondary effect on asthma, so anticholinergics are a second-line treatment for asthma, although they remain an option worth trying for some with severe asthma.  Anticholinergic medicine cause bronchodilation, although do not decrease mucus secretion.  


* **Short-Acting Anticholinergics**. They last 4-6 hours and are taken 4 times per day. Studies show they are helpful for treating acute asthma and COPD flare-ups. These include ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) and oxitropium bromide (not available in the U.S.). 
* **Long-Acting Anticholinergics**. These last 24 hours. They include tiotropium bromide (Spiriva), glycopyrrolate, (Seebri), umeclidinium (Incruse), and aclidinium bromide (Ttudorza). Older medicines include [belladonna](http://asthmahistory.blogspot.com/2015/04/1500-bc-asthma-in-ancien-egypt-ebers.html), stramonium, and atropine. Anticholinergic medicine remains second-line options for asthma and top-line options for COPD. Studies show that tiotropium bromide is slightly more effective at improving lung function, improving the quality of life, and reducing COPD flare-ups, compared with short-acting anticholinergics. Studies also show it is better at opening airways than LABA's for COPD. Side effects are negligible, with the most common being dry mouth. Incruse and Tudorza are the newer LABA's and I will look into studies regarding them in the future. 

There is a reason I listed the current medicines used and older medicines that are no longer used. This is because, over time, the molecules were adjusted to eliminate side effects and to increase the desired effect. Epinephrine, for instance, has a strong effect on a-1 leading to increased blood pressure, ß-1 leading to increased heart rate and palpitations, and ß-2 receptors leading to bronchodilation. So, while it opened airways, it also caused cardiac side effects along with tremors and nervousness. Ventolin, on the other hand, has a strong ß-2 effect with a minimal effect on a-1 and ß-1 receptors, meaning it has an equal bronchodilator effect to epinephrine with negligible side effects. Tremors and nervousness continue to be side effects, although these are acceptable tradeoffs to most asthmatics.   
Another good example is atropine. It was isolated in [1833](http://asthmahistory.blogspot.com/2016/02/1833-atropine-discovered-as-active.html) as the active ingredient of stramonium and belladonna. By the late 19th century it was routinely recommended for the treatment of asthma. Giving atropine alone was an improvement over stramonium and belladonna, which also had a strong effect on the mind, similar to marijuana. Atrovent was a mild bronchodilator, although enhance the salivatory response in the mouth, causing oral dehydration. It may also cause tachycardia. It also dilated pupils if you ever splashed it into your eyes. Atropine was a top-line asthma medicine in the 1980's, only to be replaced by Atrovent in the early 1990's. Atrovent was formulated in a way that side effects are negligible, although it can cause a dry mouth by oral absorption (which is a good reason to rinse after each use). The nebulizer solution of Atrovent, if splashed, can cause pupil dilation. The formula was modulated again to create the long-acting anticholinergics Spiriva, Incruse and Tudorza.   
So, there you have the basics of how the ANS affects the lungs and how it relates to the respiratory medicines. Any further questions, comments, or suggestion let me know in the comments below.

It also dilated pupils if you ever splashed it into your eyes. Atropine was a top-line asthma medicine in the 1980's, only to be replaced by Atrovent in the early 1990's. Atrovent was formulated in a way that side effects are negligible, although it can cause a dry mouth by oral absorption (which is a good reason to rinse after each use). The nebulizer solution of Atrovent, if splashed, can cause pupil dilation. The formula was modulated again to create the long-acting anticholinergics Spiriva, Incruse and Tudorza.   
So, there you have the basics of how the ANS affects the lungs and how it relates to the respiratory medicines. Any further questions, comments, or suggestion let me know in the comments below.

8y4575," How is it that respiratory medicines work? If your a respiratory therapist like me, a quick review is always helpful. If you're a patient, it might be neat to learn how the medicines you have in your medicine cabinet work. So, here is a quick review. Today's focus will be on beta-adrenergic medicine like albuterol and anticholinergic medicine like Spiriva.  


For starters, these types of medicines have some impact on the autonomic nervous system.  


**What is the autonomic nervous (ANS) system?** It's the system that contains all the nerves, neurons, and neurotransmitters that control all your inner organs, including your heart, blood vessels, and lungs.  
It also controls other organs, but for our purposes, we'll limit our discussion to these three.  


The ANS responds to your internal and external environment by releasing certain chemicals (we'll get to these in a moment) that bind to receptor sites (we'll get to these in a moment too) on specific organs to tell them what to do. It contains two parts.  


1. **Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)**. It stimulates your organs to respond to emergency situations. It essentially stimulates what is often referred to as the ""flight or fight"" response. 
2. **Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS)**. It inhibits (or shuts off) the SNS response. It returns your body systems back to normal status and controls these organs during normal, ordinary circumstances. 

Here are some of the bodily responses the ANS controls that we need to be concerned with. 

* **Blood Pressure**. 
   * SNS: Narrows blood vessels to speed up the flow of blood to increase blood pressure
   * PNS: Dilates blood vessels to slow the flow of blood to decrease blood pressure. 
* **Heart Rate**.
   * SNS: Speeds up the rate and force to pump blood through narrowed vessels.
   * PNS: Slows it down as less pressure is needed to pump blood through dilated vessels.
* **Airways**:
   * SNS: Dilates airways to make breathing free and easy.
   * PNS: Constricts Airways to return them to normal. 

Now we must delve into how the SNS affects these responses. To begin with, the ANS involves nerve cells that secrete neurotransmitters. There are two types of nerve cells, each of which secretes a neurotransmitter. 

1. **Adrenergic**. These are nerve cells that secrete the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which stimulates an SNS response and inhibits a PNS response. 
2. **Cholinergic**. These are nerve cells that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which stimulates a PNS response and inhibits the SNS response. 

Neurotransmitters are transmitted through neurons and are attracted to certain receptors that are attached to certain cells in specific organs. The receptors include...

1. **Adrenergic receptors**. These are receptors that norepinephrine is attracted to. Another neurotransmitter called epinephrine (adrenaline) is also attracted to them. Neurotransmitters attracted to them are called catecholamines. When a catecholamine binds to an adrenergic receptor, it stimulates some SNS response. 
2. **Cholinergic receptors**. These are receptors that acetylcholine is attracted to. When acetylcholine binds to a cholinergic receptor, it stimulates some PNS response. 

**There are two groups of adrenergic receptors**. 

* **a (Alpha)**. 
   * **a-1-Adrenergic Receptors**. They line blood vessels and when stimulated by catecholamines this causes vasoconstriction.  
* **ß (Beta) Receptors**. 
   * **ß-1 Adrenergic Receptors**. They line heart muscle tissue and are attracted to catecholamines, which cause an increase in rate and force of the heart to increase cardiac output. This is needed to create the needed pressure to pump blood through narrowed arteries. The purpose of these combined effects is to assure tissues receive adequate oxygenation during a stressful event. 
   * **ß-2 Adrenergic Receptors**. They line airway smooth muscles (from the trachea to terminal bronchioles). They are attracted to catecholamines, which cause bronchodilation to open airways. 

**Sympathomimetic Medicine**. These are medicines that are attracted to adrenergic receptors. They mimic catecholamine and include.

* S**hort-Acting Beta Agonists (SABA)**. These are medicines that are attracted to B2 receptors to relax bronchiolar smooth muscles to dilate (open) airways within minutes and only last 4-8 hours. They are non-specific to B1 and B2 receptors, and therefore offer negligible side effects. These include epinephrine (Adrenaline), albuterol (Ventolin, ProAir, Proventil), and levalbuterol (Xopenex). Some SABAs that are no longer used include Isoproterenol (isoprenaline), terbutaline, ephedrine ([Ma-huang](http://asthmahistory.blogspot.com/2014/11/2838-chinese-discover-worlds-best.html)), and Metaproterenol (Alupent). These are also referred to as rescue medicine because they open airways relatively fast. As a general rule, most experts recommend all asthmatics and COPD patients have it nearby at all times. Epinephrine has the greatest risk for stimulating B1, B2, and A1 receptors and offering side effects. The other ones currently on the market have minimal effect on B1 receptors, although some studies show that they can cause an increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and EKG changes in some individuals (although this is rare, it should be considered). The recommended dose of albuterol is 2 puffs every 4-6 ours. Studies seem to suggest that the medicine is safe for use in emergencies even at high doses, although the chronic use of high doses (using more than 6 times a day) may cause a decrease in beta 2 adrenergic receptors. This may cause tachyphylaxis, resulting in the need for even higher doses just to obtain minimal results. Excessive use of albuterol is a clear indicator of the need to seek medical attention and for physicians to consider asthma controller medicines or a step-up treatment approach for those already using controller medicines. While initial studies showed levalbuterol to offer fewer side effects to albuterol, more recent studies show it can produce the same side effects, and is therefore not superior to but equal to albuterol in as a bronchodilator, although it costs more due to a current patent. SABA's may also lower potassium. To learn more check out our post, ""[How Albuterol Lowers Potassium](http://respiratorytherapycave.blogspot.com/search?q=potassium).""
* **Long-Acting Beta Agonists (LABA)**. These are beta agonists that last 12-24 hours. These include salmeterol and formoterol. These are rarely given alone for the treatment of asthma, although they remain viable options for asthma and COPD. For asthma, they are usually included in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid in inhalers like Advair, Symbicort, Dulera, and Breo. These are generally used as asthma controller or preventive medicine, and they must be taken every day to truly be effective. For COPD, they are considered a top-line option, although some studies seem to indicate that Spiriva alone offers improved lung function and reduction in the feeling of shortness of breath compared with LABA's alone. Formoterol in Symbicort and Dulera has a rapid onset and can open airways as fast as a SABA. Serevent in Advair opens airways in about 15 minutes. 

**There are two groups of cholinergic receptors**. 

* **Muscarinic Receptors**. Acetylcholine is attracted to them. When acetylcholine binds to them, this causes airways to narrow and mucus secretion to increase. 
* **Nicotine**. I won't even go here. This is a discussion for another day. 

**Anticholinergic/ Muscarinic Medicine**. These are medicines that are attracted to Muscarinic Receptors and thereby bind to them to prevent acetylcholine from binding to them. They are called anticholinergics because they block their effects by preventing them from binding to muscarinic receptors. Cholinergic stimulation has a primary effect on COPD, so anticholinergics are a top-line treatment for COPD. Studies seem to show that anticholinergics are equal in their bronchodilation effect for a patient with COPD compared to b2 agonists, and may even have a superior bronchodilation effect. Cholinergic stimulation has a secondary effect on asthma, so anticholinergics are a second-line treatment for asthma, although they remain an option worth trying for some with severe asthma.  Anticholinergic medicine cause bronchodilation, although do not decrease mucus secretion.  


* **Short-Acting Anticholinergics**. They last 4-6 hours and are taken 4 times per day. Studies show they are helpful for treating acute asthma and COPD flare-ups. These include ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) and oxitropium bromide (not available in the U.S.). 
* **Long-Acting Anticholinergics**. These last 24 hours. They include tiotropium bromide (Spiriva), glycopyrrolate, (Seebri), umeclidinium (Incruse), and aclidinium bromide (Ttudorza). Older medicines include [belladonna](http://asthmahistory.blogspot.com/2015/04/1500-bc-asthma-in-ancien-egypt-ebers.html), stramonium, and atropine. Anticholinergic medicine remains second-line options for asthma and top-line options for COPD. Studies show that tiotropium bromide is slightly more effective at improving lung function, improving the quality of life, and reducing COPD flare-ups, compared with short-acting anticholinergics. Studies also show it is better at opening airways than LABA's for COPD. Side effects are negligible, with the most common being dry mouth. Incruse and Tudorza are the newer LABA's and I will look into studies regarding them in the future. 

There is a reason I listed the current medicines used and older medicines that are no longer used. This is because, over time, the molecules were adjusted to eliminate side effects and to increase the desired effect. Epinephrine, for instance, has a strong effect on a-1 leading to increased blood pressure, ß-1 leading to increased heart rate and palpitations, and ß-2 receptors leading to bronchodilation. So, while it opened airways, it also caused cardiac side effects along with tremors and nervousness. Ventolin, on the other hand, has a strong ß-2 effect with a minimal effect on a-1 and ß-1 receptors, meaning it has an equal bronchodilator effect to epinephrine with negligible side effects. Tremors and nervousness continue to be side effects, although these are acceptable tradeoffs to most asthmatics.   
Another good example is atropine. It was isolated in [1833](http://asthmahistory.blogspot.com/2016/02/1833-atropine-discovered-as-active.html) as the active ingredient of stramonium and belladonna. By the late 19th century it was routinely recommended for the treatment of asthma. Giving atropine alone was an improvement over stramonium and belladonna, which also had a strong effect on the mind, similar to marijuana. Atrovent was a mild bronchodilator, although enhance the salivatory response in the mouth, causing oral dehydration. It may also cause tachycardia. It also dilated pupils if you ever splashed it into your eyes. Atropine was a top-line asthma medicine in the 1980's, only to be replaced by Atrovent in the early 1990's. Atrovent was formulated in a way that side effects are negligible, although it can cause a dry mouth by oral absorption (which is a good reason to rinse after each use). The nebulizer solution of Atrovent, if splashed, can cause pupil dilation. The formula was modulated again to create the long-acting anticholinergics Spiriva, Incruse and Tudorza.   
So, there you have the basics of how the ANS affects the lungs and how it relates to the respiratory medicines. Any further questions, comments, or suggestion let me know in the comments below.

Studies seem to suggest that the medicine is safe for use in emergencies even at high doses, although the chronic use of high doses (using more than 6 times a day) may cause a decrease in beta 2 adrenergic receptors. This may cause tachyphylaxis, resulting in the need for even higher doses just to obtain minimal results. Excessive use of albuterol is a clear indicator of the need to seek medical attention and for physicians to consider asthma controller medicines or a step-up treatment approach for those already using controller medicines. While initial studies showed levalbuterol to offer fewer side effects to albuterol, more recent studies show it can produce the same side effects, and is therefore not superior to but equal to albuterol in as a bronchodilator, although it costs more due to a current patent. SABA's may also lower potassium. To learn more check out our post, ""[How Albuterol Lowers Potassium](http://respiratorytherapycave.blogspot.com/search?q=potassium).""
* **Long-Acting Beta Agonists (LABA)**. These are beta agonists that last 12-24 hours. These include salmeterol and formoterol. These are rarely given alone for the treatment of asthma, although they remain viable options for asthma and COPD. For asthma, they are usually included in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid in inhalers like Advair, Symbicort, Dulera, and Breo. These are generally used as asthma controller or preventive medicine, and they must be taken every day to truly be effective. For COPD, they are considered a top-line option, although some studies seem to indicate that Spiriva alone offers improved lung function and reduction in the feeling of shortness of breath compared with LABA's alone. Formoterol in Symbicort and Dulera has a rapid onset and can open airways as fast as a SABA. Serevent in Advair opens airways in about 15 minutes. 

**There are two groups of cholinergic receptors**. 

* **Muscarinic Receptors**. Acetylcholine is attracted to them. When acetylcholine binds to them, this causes airways to narrow and mucus secretion to increase. 
* **Nicotine**. I won't even go here. This is a discussion for another day. 

**Anticholinergic/ Muscarinic Medicine**. These are medicines that are attracted to Muscarinic Receptors and thereby bind to them to prevent acetylcholine from binding to them. They are called anticholinergics because they block their effects by preventing them from binding to muscarinic receptors. Cholinergic stimulation has a primary effect on COPD, so anticholinergics are a top-line treatment for COPD. Studies seem to show that anticholinergics are equal in their bronchodilation effect for a patient with COPD compared to b2 agonists, and may even have a superior bronchodilation effect. Cholinergic stimulation has a secondary effect on asthma, so anticholinergics are a second-line treatment for asthma, although they remain an option worth trying for some with severe asthma.  Anticholinergic medicine cause bronchodilation, although do not decrease mucus secretion.  


* **Short-Acting Anticholinergics**. They last 4-6 hours and are taken 4 times per day. Studies show they are helpful for treating acute asthma and COPD flare-ups. These include ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) and oxitropium bromide (not available in the U.S.). 
* **Long-Acting Anticholinergics**. These last 24 hours. They include tiotropium bromide (Spiriva), glycopyrrolate, (Seebri), umeclidinium (Incruse), and aclidinium bromide (Ttudorza). Older medicines include [belladonna](http://asthmahistory.blogspot.com/2015/04/1500-bc-asthma-in-ancien-egypt-ebers.html), stramonium, and atropine. Anticholinergic medicine remains second-line options for asthma and top-line options for COPD. Studies show that tiotropium bromide is slightly more effective at improving lung function, improving the quality of life, and reducing COPD flare-ups, compared with short-acting anticholinergics. Studies also show it is better at opening airways than LABA's for COPD. Side effects are negligible, with the most common being dry mouth. Incruse and Tudorza are the newer LABA's and I will look into studies regarding them in the future. 

There is a reason I listed the current medicines used and older medicines that are no longer used. This is because, over time, the molecules were adjusted to eliminate side effects and to increase the desired effect. Epinephrine, for instance, has a strong effect on a-1 leading to increased blood pressure, ß-1 leading to increased heart rate and palpitations, and ß-2 receptors leading to bronchodilation. So, while it opened airways, it also caused cardiac side effects along with tremors and nervousness. Ventolin, on the other hand, has a strong ß-2 effect with a minimal effect on a-1 and ß-1 receptors, meaning it has an equal bronchodilator effect to epinephrine with negligible side effects. Tremors and nervousness continue to be side effects, although these are acceptable tradeoffs to most asthmatics.   
Another good example is atropine. It was isolated in [1833](http://asthmahistory.blogspot.com/2016/02/1833-atropine-discovered-as-active.html) as the active ingredient of stramonium and belladonna. By the late 19th century it was routinely recommended for the treatment of asthma. Giving atropine alone was an improvement over stramonium and belladonna, which also had a strong effect on the mind, similar to marijuana. Atrovent was a mild bronchodilator, although enhance the salivatory response in the mouth, causing oral dehydration. It may also cause tachycardia. It also dilated pupils if you ever splashed it into your eyes. Atropine was a top-line asthma medicine in the 1980's, only to be replaced by Atrovent in the early 1990's. Atrovent was formulated in a way that side effects are negligible, although it can cause a dry mouth by oral absorption (which is a good reason to rinse after each use). The nebulizer solution of Atrovent, if splashed, can cause pupil dilation. The formula was modulated again to create the long-acting anticholinergics Spiriva, Incruse and Tudorza.   
So, there you have the basics of how the ANS affects the lungs and how it relates to the respiratory medicines. Any further questions, comments, or suggestion let me know in the comments below.

8y4575," How is it that respiratory medicines work? If your a respiratory therapist like me, a quick review is always helpful. If you're a patient, it might be neat to learn how the medicines you have in your medicine cabinet work. So, here is a quick review. Today's focus will be on beta-adrenergic medicine like albuterol and anticholinergic medicine like Spiriva.  


For starters, these types of medicines have some impact on the autonomic nervous system.  


**What is the autonomic nervous (ANS) system?** It's the system that contains all the nerves, neurons, and neurotransmitters that control all your inner organs, including your heart, blood vessels, and lungs.  
It also controls other organs, but for our purposes, we'll limit our discussion to these three.  


The ANS responds to your internal and external environment by releasing certain chemicals (we'll get to these in a moment) that bind to receptor sites (we'll get to these in a moment too) on specific organs to tell them what to do. It contains two parts.  


1. **Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)**. It stimulates your organs to respond to emergency situations. It essentially stimulates what is often referred to as the ""flight or fight"" response. 
2. **Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS)**. It inhibits (or shuts off) the SNS response. It returns your body systems back to normal status and controls these organs during normal, ordinary circumstances. 

Here are some of the bodily responses the ANS controls that we need to be concerned with. 

* **Blood Pressure**. 
   * SNS: Narrows blood vessels to speed up the flow of blood to increase blood pressure
   * PNS: Dilates blood vessels to slow the flow of blood to decrease blood pressure. 
* **Heart Rate**.
   * SNS: Speeds up the rate and force to pump blood through narrowed vessels.
   * PNS: Slows it down as less pressure is needed to pump blood through dilated vessels.
* **Airways**:
   * SNS: Dilates airways to make breathing free and easy.
   * PNS: Constricts Airways to return them to normal. 

Now we must delve into how the SNS affects these responses. To begin with, the ANS involves nerve cells that secrete neurotransmitters. There are two types of nerve cells, each of which secretes a neurotransmitter. 

1. **Adrenergic**. These are nerve cells that secrete the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which stimulates an SNS response and inhibits a PNS response. 
2. **Cholinergic**. These are nerve cells that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which stimulates a PNS response and inhibits the SNS response. 

Neurotransmitters are transmitted through neurons and are attracted to certain receptors that are attached to certain cells in specific organs. The receptors include...

1. **Adrenergic receptors**. These are receptors that norepinephrine is attracted to. Another neurotransmitter called epinephrine (adrenaline) is also attracted to them. Neurotransmitters attracted to them are called catecholamines. When a catecholamine binds to an adrenergic receptor, it stimulates some SNS response. 
2. **Cholinergic receptors**. These are receptors that acetylcholine is attracted to. When acetylcholine binds to a cholinergic receptor, it stimulates some PNS response. 

**There are two groups of adrenergic receptors**. 

* **a (Alpha)**. 
   * **a-1-Adrenergic Receptors**. They line blood vessels and when stimulated by catecholamines this causes vasoconstriction.  
* **ß (Beta) Receptors**. 
   * **ß-1 Adrenergic Receptors**. They line heart muscle tissue and are attracted to catecholamines, which cause an increase in rate and force of the heart to increase cardiac output. This is needed to create the needed pressure to pump blood through narrowed arteries. The purpose of these combined effects is to assure tissues receive adequate oxygenation during a stressful event. 
   * **ß-2 Adrenergic Receptors**. They line airway smooth muscles (from the trachea to terminal bronchioles). They are attracted to catecholamines, which cause bronchodilation to open airways. 

**Sympathomimetic Medicine**. These are medicines that are attracted to adrenergic receptors. They mimic catecholamine and include.

* S**hort-Acting Beta Agonists (SABA)**. These are medicines that are attracted to B2 receptors to relax bronchiolar smooth muscles to dilate (open) airways within minutes and only last 4-8 hours. They are non-specific to B1 and B2 receptors, and therefore offer negligible side effects. These include epinephrine (Adrenaline), albuterol (Ventolin, ProAir, Proventil), and levalbuterol (Xopenex). Some SABAs that are no longer used include Isoproterenol (isoprenaline), terbutaline, ephedrine ([Ma-huang](http://asthmahistory.blogspot.com/2014/11/2838-chinese-discover-worlds-best.html)), and Metaproterenol (Alupent). These are also referred to as rescue medicine because they open airways relatively fast. As a general rule, most experts recommend all asthmatics and COPD patients have it nearby at all times. Epinephrine has the greatest risk for stimulating B1, B2, and A1 receptors and offering side effects. The other ones currently on the market have minimal effect on B1 receptors, although some studies show that they can cause an increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and EKG changes in some individuals (although this is rare, it should be considered). The recommended dose of albuterol is 2 puffs every 4-6 ours. Studies seem to suggest that the medicine is safe for use in emergencies even at high doses, although the chronic use of high doses (using more than 6 times a day) may cause a decrease in beta 2 adrenergic receptors. This may cause tachyphylaxis, resulting in the need for even higher doses just to obtain minimal results. Excessive use of albuterol is a clear indicator of the need to seek medical attention and for physicians to consider asthma controller medicines or a step-up treatment approach for those already using controller medicines. While initial studies showed levalbuterol to offer fewer side effects to albuterol, more recent studies show it can produce the same side effects, and is therefore not superior to but equal to albuterol in as a bronchodilator, although it costs more due to a current patent. SABA's may also lower potassium. To learn more check out our post, ""[How Albuterol Lowers Potassium](http://respiratorytherapycave.blogspot.com/search?q=potassium).""

just for some context, i used to smoke weed daily for about 4 or 5 years. through out that time i've been seeing psychologist but never took any medication for major depressive disorder. about a year and a half ago i started treatment for depression with things like zelax, remeron and more recently seroquel 50mg. 2 or 3 months ago, i got my first bipolar 2 diagnoses and was prescribed 400mg of lithium.

now as soon as i got on lithium the nausea started and the depression was setting back in as i weened off the antidepressants.
after a month i got on 800mg and the nausea began getting unbearable and the depression was back 150%.

i smoke weed now, here n there to help alleviate these symptoms. the psychiatrist says it interferes with the lithium in a very bad way and will make things worse.
but it helps so much with the physical pain and the nausea and the headaches and the tremors. on top of that, it makes life bearable on an emotional level too. im not constantly baraded by a negative self defeatist inner monolog, it's more of logical supportive voice. and i'm not stuck in the past as much. way better at pulling myself out of painful memories and back into the real world. i don't feel clouded by emotions when im decision making. it all feels a lot more clear. idk.

does anyone have any experiences like this?
do you think i should keep smoking or should i take my doc's advice? from what im seeing online it seems to be a bad idea to mix the two.",nausea

I'm going through the motions of getting diagnosed right now and I'm getting retested for Narcolepsy at the end of the month (last time I was on Seroquel which supresses REM). I have to be off my antidepressants for two weeks before the test. I weened for a few weeks and then had about a week of withdrawal symptoms when I stopped, but once those cleared away, CHRIST.    

I'm more creative than I've been, can think and read faster, and my speech is so much clearer (less garbled, word slurring, etc). It's wonderful. My brains hit a gear that's been missing for a few years, but my body can't keep up with it :/. Still exhausted in every other way.    

Right now I'm in a good headspace, but we'll see how things go with my mood going forward. I'm going to try to stay off them after my test. Either way, I just wanted to share as I'm sure a lot of other CFSers take antidepressants.

8yvwkk,"I am a 29-year-old female, and I have never been in a relationship for longer than a year. But that was hardly a relationship. The only one longer than four months was more of an arrangement, to be honest. I used to be stereotypically attractive, before gaining weight due to antidepressants. But even when I was at my peak physical shape, I was still used and tossed aside repeatedly. 

No person I have ever loved has ever loved me back... while everyone else has been dating for years, getting engaged, married, kids, etc. I have had my heart broken so many times, I stopped trying to date someone I have feelings for...over three years ago after a rough time. I just can't go through the heartache of being rejected again. But I cannot blame those who reject me. To be fair, I'm not exactly the prize one can expect me to be. I am bisexual, but no women I have liked have ever liked me back either. Still, I cannot blame anyone. Here is why:

1. I have bipolar disorder. Despite attempting 10+ years of therapy and trying over two dozen antidepressants, plus seeing many many doctors, I have come to the realization that nothing works on me. I have not responded well to anything, but Seroquel, which made things substantially worse.

2. Due to the medications and extended depressed episodes, I have gained 50 pounds within 6 months. I am only 5'3"", so this is a huge amount for my size. I used to be pretty, but my looks are gone already. I'm not even 30, and I'm already ugly. I cannot fit into any of my clothes anymore. I have tried too many times to lose, but my metabolism is shot to shit. FUCK SEROQUEL!!!

3. I am an alcoholic. I drink to try to suppress my depression and anxiety, while contributing to my weight gain and obviously causing all sorts of problems. No one wants to deal with the issues of dating an alcoholic. I understand this. Doctors refuse to treat my anxiety, so I have turned to alcohol to treat my panic disorders. I need actual medication for my anxiety; despite many diagnoses, years of antidepressants not working, it doesn't matter. No one wants to help me.

4. I am a former sex worker. This fact is what really makes people run. I faced some unfortunate circumstances when I was younger, so I needed money quick. That being said, I started stripping at 20, then escorting at 23. Although I quit over two years ago and have passed every STI test I have taken since then, this does not matter. The fact I have worked in the industry in the first place either turns everyone off, or attracts broke people looking to mooch off of me. This too has happened too many times.

Like I said, I don't blame anyone for not wanting to be with me. I'm not saying or implying that anyone should look past these transgressions and love me for me, because I know that will not work. I don't want to burden anyone with my problems, but I am lonely as hell. I am simply undatable, and I will be lonely forever. I accept this and am trying to work through it. 

Edit: Thank you so much for your responses. I know I need to stop drinking, and I always plan on it, sometimes stick with it for a day or so, and then relapse again. It's happened over a thousand times, and it doesn't help that a liquor store is across the street from me. Excuses, excuses, I know. But y'all are absolutely right. Also, the intense withdrawal symptoms from Seroquel (my prescribed dose is 300 mg/day) make it impossible to stop taking. I've cut it down to 100 mg, but it's still very hard to lose weight. But without it, I literally cannot sleep for weeks at a time",gaining weight 
8yvwkk,"I am a 29-year-old female, and I have never been in a relationship for longer than a year. But that was hardly a relationship. The only one longer than four months was more of an arrangement, to be honest. I used to be stereotypically attractive, before gaining weight due to antidepressants. But even when I was at my peak physical shape, I was still used and tossed aside repeatedly. 

No person I have ever loved has ever loved me back... while everyone else has been dating for years, getting engaged, married, kids, etc. I have had my heart broken so many times, I stopped trying to date someone I have feelings for...over three years ago after a rough time. I just can't go through the heartache of being rejected again. But I cannot blame those who reject me. To be fair, I'm not exactly the prize one can expect me to be. I am bisexual, but no women I have liked have ever liked me back either. Still, I cannot blame anyone. Here is why:

1. I have bipolar disorder. Despite attempting 10+ years of therapy and trying over two dozen antidepressants, plus seeing many many doctors, I have come to the realization that nothing works on me. I have not responded well to anything, but Seroquel, which made things substantially worse.

2. Due to the medications and extended depressed episodes, I have gained 50 pounds within 6 months. I am only 5'3"", so this is a huge amount for my size. I used to be pretty, but my looks are gone already. I'm not even 30, and I'm already ugly. I cannot fit into any of my clothes anymore. I have tried too many times to lose, but my metabolism is shot to shit. FUCK SEROQUEL!!!

Meds: Ativan, Valium, Paxil, Seroquel, Bisoprolol; currently using topical bactroban on a boil

A lot of this is that I have had a really hard time being able to see my PCP because he's so busy and has been on vacation a lot so everything is backed up. I've had two urgent care visits over the last couple of months and a single lab visit to his office but haven't actually seen him. So I have lab results but no one to interface with.

So earlier this summer I had been sweating like crazy, had a low grade fever (was measured as 100.8 in urgent care), just felt like my body had an infection in that my pulse was up (I have some sort of POTS-like symptoms that get worse when I have an infection).

The urgent care did a CBC that came back normal, except slightly high lymphocytes (I think like 3.2 maybe).

I went on a vacation and while I was there I was still hot and sweating all the time. Due to what is maybe a moral failing or maybe my mental illness, I barely ever brush my teeth. But on vacation I brushed my teeth for the first time in a long time. I mention that only in case it may be related.

I started getting a sore throat and I noticed getting spots all over my mouth. I get red spots all over that I thought maybe were herpes. I wasn't sure. I have never had any sexual activity. Never had a cold sore before. At the same time this happened I got a very painful sore inside my nostril. It felt like something was in my nose. I shouldn't have picked at it, but I did with a glove. This amber, crystal like stuff would come out, but whatever was actually there wouldn't budge. It like a scab that wouldn't come off. The stuff that came out looked like dried ooze of a scab.

So when I got back home from the vacation, I went to an urgent care doctor about the nose--by that time the red lesions in my mouth were gone but I had taken pictures.

I showed him the pictures and he said it was herpes. He did blood tests, but they were kind of weird (and I didn't know what he had tested until LabCorp sent me the results). He did an HSV-2 IGG test which was negative (I'm not sure why he ordered that since I've never had sexual contact and the lesions were all in my mouth and the thing in my nose). And he ordered a combo HSV-1/HSV-2 IGM which came back equivocal. I have since read the CDC does not recommend doing HSV IGM testing.

So I texted my PCP. The thing is that it's nearly impossible to see him for an appointment but if I text him with something actionable, he'll do it. Or if he said if he can reply in 2-3 words he'll write back. Otherwise he ignores the texts.

So I asked him to add the HSV-1 IGG which came back negative.

I still had this painful thing in my nose, so I asked if he could squeeze me in and he said only for a lab visit to swab it.

So the nurse swabbed it for HSV DNA and for staph and bacterial cultures. But I didn't actually talk to him.

Of course, the office never calls. I get the lab reports from LabCorp sent to my e-mail 7 days after the doctor gets them.

The lab report said HSV DNA tested negative but I had an abnormally high amount of staph aureus in my nose. It even gave a list of medications that this particular isolate is not resistant to.

So they've had this info for over a week but no one called me (no one ever calls from doctor's offices with lab results---thank god the labs send them out now).

So I can't get an appointment sooner, but I texted him because of these results and also because in the mean time I've been getting the mouth sores again, I've also gotten a finger where the cuticle pulled back on its own and it got puffy, and I got a boil on the small of my back.

So before I got the lab report I was self treating the finger and boil with bacitracin and it wasn't working. I had an old tube of Bactroban (still in date) that I started and it seems to be working on the boil a bit.

But I texted him to ask if I should be on one of these oral antibiotics that the lab report mentioned. The thing is that I don't still have that sore in my nose, but I'm still hot, sweaty, have headaches all the time, and my nose has been putting out a LOT more green boogers than usual (it comes dried instead of snot I think maybe because I'm on anticholinergic meds).

All he texted back was ""Use bactrian"" (it's not even bacitracin or bactroban) --I don't even know which he meant.

I sent more texts but he didn't write back.

I don't know if all this is related to my really poor oral hygiene. It seemed like the outbreak happened AFTER I brushed my teeth for the first time in probably months. But I don't know if it's that or not. I know I should brush my teeth but I have this fear of worsening whatever is going on and causing bacteremia since I know I'll bleed a lot. I've told him all of this but haven't gotten a response. I have an appt July 31.

I'm not a person who likes taking antibiotics or seeks them out. The last time I was on one was a very long time ago for an infected cyst on my back where I had to take it in order to have surgery on the cyst.

I'm just not sure where this staph aureus came from and if it's related to transfer from my poor oral hygiene to the nose, and if it's at all related to the boil and being hot and sweaty. Not sure if I should be on an antibiotic.

I really don't like going to Urgent Care because they tend to tell me I should be seeing my PCP instead. He's really, really, really nice, but he's just so overbooked, and then his vacation means that the office said they've triple booked him for weeks out now.

So they've had this info for over a week but no one called me (no one ever calls from doctor's offices with lab results---thank god the labs send them out now).

So I can't get an appointment sooner, but I texted him because of these results and also because in the mean time I've been getting the mouth sores again, I've also gotten a finger where the cuticle pulled back on its own and it got puffy, and I got a boil on the small of my back.

So before I got the lab report I was self treating the finger and boil with bacitracin and it wasn't working. I had an old tube of Bactroban (still in date) that I started and it seems to be working on the boil a bit.

But I texted him to ask if I should be on one of these oral antibiotics that the lab report mentioned. The thing is that I don't still have that sore in my nose, but I'm still hot, sweaty, have headaches all the time, and my nose has been putting out a LOT more green boogers than usual (it comes dried instead of snot I think maybe because I'm on anticholinergic meds).

All he texted back was ""Use bactrian"" (it's not even bacitracin or bactroban) --I don't even know which he meant.

I sent more texts but he didn't write back.

I don't know if all this is related to my really poor oral hygiene. It seemed like the outbreak happened AFTER I brushed my teeth for the first time in probably months. But I don't know if it's that or not. I know I should brush my teeth but I have this fear of worsening whatever is going on and causing bacteremia since I know I'll bleed a lot. I've told him all of this but haven't gotten a response. I have an appt July 31.

I'm not a person who likes taking antibiotics or seeks them out. The last time I was on one was a very long time ago for an infected cyst on my back where I had to take it in order to have surgery on the cyst.

I'm just not sure where this staph aureus came from and if it's related to transfer from my poor oral hygiene to the nose, and if it's at all related to the boil and being hot and sweaty. Not sure if I should be on an antibiotic.

I really don't like going to Urgent Care because they tend to tell me I should be seeing my PCP instead. He's really, really, really nice, but he's just so overbooked, and then his vacation means that the office said they've triple booked him for weeks out now.

A lot of this is that I have had a really hard time being able to see my PCP because he's so busy and has been on vacation a lot so everything is backed up. I've had two urgent care visits over the last couple of months and a single lab visit to his office but haven't actually seen him. So I have lab results but no one to interface with.

So earlier this summer I had been sweating like crazy, had a low grade fever (was measured as 100.8 in urgent care), just felt like my body had an infection in that my pulse was up (I have some sort of POTS-like symptoms that get worse when I have an infection).

The urgent care did a CBC that came back normal, except slightly high lymphocytes (I think like 3.2 maybe).

I went on a vacation and while I was there I was still hot and sweating all the time. Due to what is maybe a moral failing or maybe my mental illness, I barely ever brush my teeth. But on vacation I brushed my teeth for the first time in a long time. I mention that only in case it may be related.

I started getting a sore throat and I noticed getting spots all over my mouth. I get red spots all over that I thought maybe were herpes. I wasn't sure. I have never had any sexual activity. Never had a cold sore before. At the same time this happened I got a very painful sore inside my nostril. It felt like something was in my nose. I shouldn't have picked at it, but I did with a glove. This amber, crystal like stuff would come out, but whatever was actually there wouldn't budge. It like a scab that wouldn't come off. The stuff that came out looked like dried ooze of a scab.

So when I got back home from the vacation, I went to an urgent care doctor about the nose--by that time the red lesions in my mouth were gone but I had taken pictures.

I showed him the pictures and he said it was herpes. He did blood tests, but they were kind of weird (and I didn't know what he had tested until LabCorp sent me the results). He did an HSV-2 IGG test which was negative (I'm not sure why he ordered that since I've never had sexual contact and the lesions were all in my mouth and the thing in my nose). And he ordered a combo HSV-1/HSV-2 IGM which came back equivocal. I have since read the CDC does not recommend doing HSV IGM testing.

So I texted my PCP. The thing is that it's nearly impossible to see him for an appointment but if I text him with something actionable, he'll do it. Or if he said if he can reply in 2-3 words he'll write back. Otherwise he ignores the texts.

So I asked him to add the HSV-1 IGG which came back negative.

I still had this painful thing in my nose, so I asked if he could squeeze me in and he said only for a lab visit to swab it.

So the nurse swabbed it for HSV DNA and for staph and bacterial cultures. But I didn't actually talk to him.

I did a test years ago when I was living in Australia before my diagnosis and it was extremely low  but my doctor told me to ignore it as he wasn't sure if it was accurate. 

Cue 6 years later i have a bipolar diagnosis and I recently  tried DHEA supplement as I thought it would help with focus and it made me feel really unwell for over a week ie depressed and physically exhausted after only taking it for 2 days. It wasn't even a high dose so really the only way that could happen is if my cortisol was already really low as DHEA would lower it further.

This got me thinking as I take naproxen to lower inflammation as this has eradicated depression in me and allowed me to stop 2 antidepressants and seroquel and lower my lithium to 400mg ( yes I know it's not good to take an NSAID and lithium so will be stopping lithium soon)

If you have low cortisol it drives up inflammation. I get depressed in winter and illness and cortisol should go higher in both but if I have really low cortisol this would explain the spikes in inflammation as inflammation interferes with neurotransmitter production and why naproxen therefore stabalises my mood.

I just wondered if anyone has ever had cortisol tested ? As I read that it is common to be low or really high in depression or mania in bipolar

I've just ordered £500 of private tests including cortisol DHEA testosterone estrogen levels and precursors to neurotransmitters as well as Homocysteine and B12 

So I've ordered likea maybe 25 tests to test the things I always wanted to test and what a doctor would not test.

May be over kill but I got fed up of doctors refusing to test my inflamitory levels and have never once been tested for causes other than kidney liver and thyroid purely to ensure their lithium they give me doesn't cause damage. 


I'm not saying it's the main cause in all of us, there are many causes combining in each of us and although I've stabalised my mood other than that DHEA blip I wish to know the causes and why the things I take work.  just I feel this may be part of it in me and wondered if anyone has low cortisol. I should get my results back in a few weeks.

May be over kill but I got fed up of doctors refusing to test my inflamitory levels and have never once been tested for causes other than kidney liver and thyroid purely to ensure their lithium they give me doesn't cause damage. 


I'm not saying it's the main cause in all of us, there are many causes combining in each of us and although I've stabalised my mood other than that DHEA blip I wish to know the causes and why the things I take work.  just I feel this may be part of it in me and wondered if anyone has low cortisol. I should get my results back in a few weeks.

I did get some heat flurries before, and a little bit of euphoria, but only for a few seconds, so could have been placebo

8y3fo4,"EDIT: the following post was written under the influence of a lot of amphetamines and upon re-reading is just a confusing word salad. but more importantly abusing adderall isnt worth it, i am currently not having a very good time cuz when the effects of the adderall left my system they decided to leave some good ol hallucinations and just a overall very not good mental state. i am not doing very well at all. also i ended up overheating without really being aware of it which made me completely disconnect from reality and write a ton of gibberish while in a delirious state. it was strange. would not recommend. also it wasnt really that great and it sure as hell wasnt worth what appears to be psychosis as well as no sleep. my brain feels sludgy. yuck.

quick second edit: currently on night two. i can tell how unhealthy this is but i just cant stop, as observing this slide into being nonfunctional is incredibly interesting. writing is harder and i use weird shitty words for some reason. very irritable. decaying. quite a few vivid auditory hallucinations already as long as a couple of visual ones and a spice of delusion. i am so irritated. all of the euphoria from adderall was gone the first time so now every re-dose is just more irritation. my hair is fucking falling out. rapidly. my skin is a palette of strange colors that do not belong. things arent very good.


so i’m bipolar, and i’m currently in a insane depressive episode where essentially all i’ve been hoping for is another manic episode because at least i’m happy and motivated and not useless during them. i’ve been using drugs to deal with these intense self destructive impulsive so i’ve ended up taking up smoking, getting ridiculously drunk multiple days in a row (and overall as often as possible, i hope i’m not considered a alcoholic but i’m afraid i’m well into that diagnosis) and i have abused vicodin and codeine, taken a dangerously high amount of acetaminophen in one of the much lower swings, and have developed a nicotine addiction. in all of that mess, i ended up with a fucking ton of adderall and decided to take 10 pills. i am currently very amphetamine’d up and it is ridiculously similar to the intense heights of mania in my opinion. incredible energy, tons of motivation, talking to everybody on the phone at the same time, wearing few clothes and being a fucking dumbass, doing handstands, and just loving everything. i really hope this doesnt become a habit but i cant see it not being one either. i just want to fall apart. i dont understand how i am this self destructive but i have hallucinated before and had very scary psychosis and i just want that. i want to mentally disintegrate and i dont know why. i dont idealize it, i dont think of it as cool, i dont want pity, i just want to slowly devolve into insanity until i finally kill myself and maybe its because then it’d give me a reason to end things. what a fuckin mess, am i right? and i should be so happy, i have a girlfriend who i fuckin love and everything is great and i have so many friends but i just hate myself and dont know how to deal with it. at least on adderall now it just feels bittersweet and i understand the sadness is what adds depth to my view of the world, without these intense chemical imbalances where the world is a dark, evil place, i would never be able to respect the indescribable beauty in the mundane.

anyways, also i’m male and 16 if those details mean anything to the story. i prefer newports but smoking is fucking gross and i recommend nobody ever start. its just a problem i’ve been working on quitting. put lemon or lime juice in vodka and slam it to just get drunk with not too much of the gross taste. merlot is fucking awful. i dont play video games but earthbound and mother 3 are both indescribably beautiful. i’ve started prozac. i’m also on lithium and seroquel. i took a lot of seroquel a while ago and it felt a bit like my brain was melting but in a okay way. i didnt die. beer is gross and doesnt get you drunk fast enough. i only drink to get drunk. i hope someday to experience delirium tremens. i’ve attempted to drink a ton of days in row before to do it but i didnt get anywhere. adderall is great but please nobody go down the path of drugs. especially opiates. no adderall either. weed is overrated and fuck “stoners”, its a stupid personality crutch for people who are boring and want to make up for it in marijuana. i love you meredith. i am not wearing a shirt and i am in 7/11 and i’m wearing jorts but jorts are pretty stupid but its okay. this is more of a diary now. i love synthesizers and really want to buy a roland juno-60. i can link my soundcloud if anyone is interested in hearing weird ‘80s synthpop made with all genuine analog equipment and no DAWs. ok thanks. bye everyone. i love you all and understand what youre going through because i am too and i just want everybody to be strong.

quick edit: i also have borderline personality disorder, which really adds to the intensity of the mood swings and the instability of my self image. i’m sure it also is what leads to my propensity to both experiment with drugs and also become dependent on them. i also worry about how easily i become attached to people and how i possibly feel emotions (such as love) to a degree few others mirror, so i will struggle eternally to feel like i have a truly mutual and balanced connection with nearly anyone. plus sometimes i just instantly lose feelings for people when they start to have feelings for me, which just further complicates my worries for how long i can sustain living within this personality i put up to other people to hide how troubled i am underneath. also i’m not wearing a shirt but i didnt get kicked out of the 7/11 for it so i guess thats pretty cool. its free slushie day so why not take advantage of that. i love thrift shopping because they have awesome ‘80s clothes and i have a deep genuine love for the ‘80s due to me growing up with a ton of my parents belongings from when they were near my age (including my dads david bowie vinyl collection!) so it’s deeply influenced my main interests and my music tastes. (i love new order, omd, george clanton, oneohtrix point never, percival pembroke, sales, bulldog eyes, alex g, arthur shea, software, esprit, satin sheets, and i’ll add more in a bit). also i have a deep love for psychology and have done a insane amount of studying into topics such as attachment theory, freud’s theories, the past of psychology (and textbooks from the 60’s), and schizophrenia (as more of a case subject of psychosis and that spectrum of mental illness instead of just the illness on its own). also i dont want to come off as a pseudo-intellectual, i used some big words in this but its just because no other words appeared in my mind that fit as well and i probably misused them all anyways. i used to be pretty smart in elementary school (lol) but then mental illness backhanded me in middle school and i’ve been a shitty unmotivated student since. maybe if i can maintain the motivation i have right now i’ll be able to manage. oh well.

also i know i’m young and it’s very easy to dismiss this all because it’ll all okay in time but really in the deepest depths of depression none of that means shit and i’d like to find a way to deal with this so i’ll be alive to see that point in the future. i understand everything i’ve said is stupid and reading it must come off as a pathetic mess of words and i feel the same but maybe somebody might feel a lil spice of empathy by reading this and thats all i really need. i’ll make it through all of this, i think.

okay i’m done with the edit now

quick second edit: i took 2 more adderall and bought a pair of pink sweatpants at goodwill because why not. they were way overpriced. also, super important music: i fucking love hiroshi yoshimura beyond articulation. he means so much to me. i got the vinyl represses from music for nine post cards and pier and loft which were quite expensive but who cares because theyre beautiful and i cried like a little bitch for both first listens. also listen to his album “flora 1987” and “green”, the title track from green is indescribable. please listen to him for me kay? thanks.

8y3fo4,"EDIT: the following post was written under the influence of a lot of amphetamines and upon re-reading is just a confusing word salad. but more importantly abusing adderall isnt worth it, i am currently not having a very good time cuz when the effects of the adderall left my system they decided to leave some good ol hallucinations and just a overall very not good mental state. i am not doing very well at all. also i ended up overheating without really being aware of it which made me completely disconnect from reality and write a ton of gibberish while in a delirious state. it was strange. would not recommend. also it wasnt really that great and it sure as hell wasnt worth what appears to be psychosis as well as no sleep. my brain feels sludgy. yuck.

quick second edit: currently on night two. i can tell how unhealthy this is but i just cant stop, as observing this slide into being nonfunctional is incredibly interesting. writing is harder and i use weird shitty words for some reason. very irritable. decaying. quite a few vivid auditory hallucinations already as long as a couple of visual ones and a spice of delusion. i am so irritated. all of the euphoria from adderall was gone the first time so now every re-dose is just more irritation. my hair is fucking falling out. rapidly. my skin is a palette of strange colors that do not belong. things arent very good.


so i’m bipolar, and i’m currently in a insane depressive episode where essentially all i’ve been hoping for is another manic episode because at least i’m happy and motivated and not useless during them. i’ve been using drugs to deal with these intense self destructive impulsive so i’ve ended up taking up smoking, getting ridiculously drunk multiple days in a row (and overall as often as possible, i hope i’m not considered a alcoholic but i’m afraid i’m well into that diagnosis) and i have abused vicodin and codeine, taken a dangerously high amount of acetaminophen in one of the much lower swings, and have developed a nicotine addiction. in all of that mess, i ended up with a fucking ton of adderall and decided to take 10 pills. i am currently very amphetamine’d up and it is ridiculously similar to the intense heights of mania in my opinion. incredible energy, tons of motivation, talking to everybody on the phone at the same time, wearing few clothes and being a fucking dumbass, doing handstands, and just loving everything. i really hope this doesnt become a habit but i cant see it not being one either. i just want to fall apart. i dont understand how i am this self destructive but i have hallucinated before and had very scary psychosis and i just want that. i want to mentally disintegrate and i dont know why. i dont idealize it, i dont think of it as cool, i dont want pity, i just want to slowly devolve into insanity until i finally kill myself and maybe its because then it’d give me a reason to end things. what a fuckin mess, am i right? and i should be so happy, i have a girlfriend who i fuckin love and everything is great and i have so many friends but i just hate myself and dont know how to deal with it. at least on adderall now it just feels bittersweet and i understand the sadness is what adds depth to my view of the world, without these intense chemical imbalances where the world is a dark, evil place, i would never be able to respect the indescribable beauty in the mundane.

anyways, also i’m male and 16 if those details mean anything to the story. i prefer newports but smoking is fucking gross and i recommend nobody ever start. its just a problem i’ve been working on quitting. put lemon or lime juice in vodka and slam it to just get drunk with not too much of the gross taste. merlot is fucking awful. i dont play video games but earthbound and mother 3 are both indescribably beautiful. i’ve started prozac. i’m also on lithium and seroquel. i took a lot of seroquel a while ago and it felt a bit like my brain was melting but in a okay way. i didnt die. beer is gross and doesnt get you drunk fast enough. i only drink to get drunk. i hope someday to experience delirium tremens. i’ve attempted to drink a ton of days in row before to do it but i didnt get anywhere. adderall is great but please nobody go down the path of drugs. especially opiates. no adderall either. weed is overrated and fuck “stoners”, its a stupid personality crutch for people who are boring and want to make up for it in marijuana. i love you meredith. i am not wearing a shirt and i am in 7/11 and i’m wearing jorts but jorts are pretty stupid but its okay. this is more of a diary now. i love synthesizers and really want to buy a roland juno-60. i can link my soundcloud if anyone is interested in hearing weird ‘80s synthpop made with all genuine analog equipment and no DAWs. ok thanks. bye everyone. i love you all and understand what youre going through because i am too and i just want everybody to be strong.

quick edit: i also have borderline personality disorder, which really adds to the intensity of the mood swings and the instability of my self image. i’m sure it also is what leads to my propensity to both experiment with drugs and also become dependent on them. i also worry about how easily i become attached to people and how i possibly feel emotions (such as love) to a degree few others mirror, so i will struggle eternally to feel like i have a truly mutual and balanced connection with nearly anyone. plus sometimes i just instantly lose feelings for people when they start to have feelings for me, which just further complicates my worries for how long i can sustain living within this personality i put up to other people to hide how troubled i am underneath. also i’m not wearing a shirt but i didnt get kicked out of the 7/11 for it so i guess thats pretty cool. its free slushie day so why not take advantage of that. i love thrift shopping because they have awesome ‘80s clothes and i have a deep genuine love for the ‘80s due to me growing up with a ton of my parents belongings from when they were near my age (including my dads david bowie vinyl collection!) so it’s deeply influenced my main interests and my music tastes. (i love new order, omd, george clanton, oneohtrix point never, percival pembroke, sales, bulldog eyes, alex g, arthur shea, software, esprit, satin sheets, and i’ll add more in a bit). also i have a deep love for psychology and have done a insane amount of studying into topics such as attachment theory, freud’s theories, the past of psychology (and textbooks from the 60’s), and schizophrenia (as more of a case subject of psychosis and that spectrum of mental illness instead of just the illness on its own). also i dont want to come off as a pseudo-intellectual, i used some big words in this but its just because no other words appeared in my mind that fit as well and i probably misused them all anyways. i used to be pretty smart in elementary school (lol) but then mental illness backhanded me in middle school and i’ve been a shitty unmotivated student since. maybe if i can maintain the motivation i have right now i’ll be able to manage. oh well.

also i know i’m young and it’s very easy to dismiss this all because it’ll all okay in time but really in the deepest depths of depression none of that means shit and i’d like to find a way to deal with this so i’ll be alive to see that point in the future. i understand everything i’ve said is stupid and reading it must come off as a pathetic mess of words and i feel the same but maybe somebody might feel a lil spice of empathy by reading this and thats all i really need. i’ll make it through all of this, i think.

First time I mixed the two I didn't connect the dots, but the second time I figured it out.

Can someone explain the science behind this. 

I'm a long time Kratom user, I use it mainly for energy as I suffer from fatigue. I barely use it these days, only when necessary.

Lithium Orotate, which I discovered recently,  relaxes me and slow my running thoughts, it helped me cut on smoking, it helped finally set down and think, whereas I would always had my brain constantly on turbo and I always was holding my phone to keep it busy.

8yqv0a,"So I quit drinking 15 days ago after a 7 month binge. I’ve struggled with alcohol for the past 15 years. About 6 years ago I was withdrawing from alcohol and along with detox meds was put on Paxil. Started at 10mg, now I’m on 60mg, dr kept upping the dose cause i was slip back into anxiety. I first experienced these dizzy spells while I was sober and forgot to take my Paxil one day. The following day it was like I’d be walking and just felt like my head spun real quick or the ground below me waved, only while standing though, never sitting or laying. Fast forward to last August I entered a rehab for my drinking, was given Valium for like ten days for the withdrawals, then weaned down thruout the last few days. The first few nights off of the Valium I felt these dizzy spells at night. Same as if I didn’t take a Paxil. They passed with time, I wasn’t drinking nearly as much or as long I was sober a while and relapsed for like two weeks before entering this rehab. Now fast forward to November. I thought it was a good idea to drink again, immediately started noticing the dizzy spells while drinking. Some days were worse, some days were non existent. So 15 days ago I realized that I’m in my mid 30’s drinking alone drinking entirely too much, like ridiculously too much, and I wasn’t feeling good. It wasn’t working like it did before. It honestly hasn’t in years. So I went to the dr and got a 10 day Librium with drawl protocol and now I’m off the Librium 5 days and off the alcohol 15 days and feel good and motivated about it. It was my decision and I wasn’t forced into rehab or to get sober by family or law enforcement. I want it. But now I’m getting these dizzy spells, at night around dusk they start and it’s like every time I stand up. Starting to scare me. Hoping it will pass soon. I guess I’m posting this to see if anyone has any advice, experience, or even critism. I’m also very Overweight, case of beers almost daily will do that. And I take lisinopril (BP) and breo (asthma) in the morning. And remeron (sleep) and clonodine (sleep/BP) and a antihistamine (sleep) at night cause I have insomnia for sure. I also quit smoking the same day I quit drinking. Thanks all who read.

8yd5xd,"I'll try and keep this as brief as possible because it's long.

Recovered alcoholic for 13 years tomorrow. Dealt with bad depression afterwards, was on anti depressants for almost 10 years \[paxil\]. 

Decided one day I would come off \[last August\] them only tapering for 7 days \[upon my general practitioners request smh\] needless to say that 2 months was a terrible time for me with the withdrawls. They say you need a stable lifestyle to come off them, during that phase. Well it wasn't and a bunch of bad stuff happened. Anyways

Then in January I went to a psychologist and we did EMDR and she revealed to me that I suffered child abuse \[which also made sense to me\]. after 2 sessions I started getting really bad anxiety attacks and panic attacks. I am still not on anti depressants but they switched my ADHD meds afterward. I also gave up drinking caffeine because of this which helped a lot with the attacks they occur less frequently now but I still have them.

My problem now is that I seem to hold my breath a lot and not breathe properly, my resting heart rate is always really high \[lying down it's like 96-100 most of the time\]. I go to the gym every day and do cardio and it slows it down a bit but not much. Does anyone have similar experiences ? Is this maybe my body adjusting with not being on anti depressants anymore? I also lost close to 40 pounds since last year since I came off them too. I also have a really hard time winding down at night to go to sleep

It's also not ideal because I work out of town by myself all the time with no co workers.

The self care things I do: 

1. Meditate twice a day \[when waking up then before sleep\]
2. Pray several times a day
3. Go to AA meetings
4. Talk on the phone to a friend once a day or twice a day \[I often cry every day when I talk to someone about myself\]
5. Staying single because I know I have to in my life right now

I also have really low self esteem I don't know how to really build that up anymore.  If anyone has any suggestions or experiences regarding the high pulse and the not breathing properly let me know. I know the not breathing properly thing was happening before I did the EMDR. Thanks Reddit <3", withdrawls

I also have really low self esteem I don't know how to really build that up anymore.  If anyone has any suggestions or experiences regarding the high pulse and the not breathing properly let me know. I know the not breathing properly thing was happening before I did the EMDR. Thanks Reddit <3",attacks

8y12vu,"In her recent PLoS Medicine article, Christine Phillips writes: “ADHD [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder] joins dyslexia and glue ear as disorders that are considered significant primarily because of their effects on educational performance” . A “disorder” is “a disturbance of function, structure, or both,” and thus, the equivalent of an objective abnormality/disease . In neurologically normal children, dyslexia cannot be proved to be a disorder/disease. “Glue ear,” however, is otitis media, an objective abnormality/ disease. Phillips continues: “In the case of ADHD, there has been a complex, often heated debate in the public domain about the verity of the illness,” but proceeds, without an answer, to consider “the roles of teachers as brokers for ADHD and its treatment.”

In 1948, “neuropsychiatry” was divided into “neurology,” dealing with diseases, and “psychiatry,” dealing with emotions and behaviors . If there is a macroscopic, microscopic, or chemical abnormality, a disease is present. Nowhere in the brains or bodies of children said to have ADHD or any other psychiatric diagnosis has a disorder/disease been confirmed. Psychiatric drugs appeared in the fifties. Psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry authored the “chemical imbalance” market strategy: they would call all things psychological “chemical imbalances” needing “chemical balancers”—pills.

At the September 29, 1970, hearing on Federal Involvement in the Use of Behavior Modification Drugs on Grammar School Children, Ronald Lipman of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), argued: “hyperkinesis is a medical syndrome. It should be properly diagnosed by a medical doctor” .

In 1986, Nasrallah et al. reported brain atrophy in adult males treated with amphetamines as children, concluding: “since all of the HK/MBD [hyperkinetic/minimal brain dysfunction] patients had been treated with psychostimulants, cortical atrophy may be a long-term adverse effect of this treatment.”

At the 1998 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference on ADHD, Carey stated: “The ADHD behaviors are assumed to be largely or entirely due to abnormal brain function. The DSM-IV does not say so but textbooks and journals do.... What is now most often described as ADHD...appears to be a set of normal behavioral variations.”

However Swanson and Castellanos , having reviewed the structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research, testified: “Recent investigations provide converging evidence that a refined phenotype of ADHD/HKD (hyperkinetic disorder) is characterized by reduced size in specific neuroanatomical regions of the frontal lobes and basal ganglia.” I challenged Swanson, asking: “Why didn't you mention that virtually all of the ADHD subjects were on stimulant therapy—the likely cause of their brain atrophy?” [8] Swanson confessed this was so—that there had been no such studies of ADHD-untreated cohorts.

The Consensus Conference Panel concluded: “We do not have a valid test for ADHD... there are no data to indicate that ADHD is a brain malfunction” . (This wording appeared in the version of the final statement of the Consensus Conference Panel distributed at the press conference in the final part of the Consensus Conference, November 18, 1998. This wording, which appeared for an indeterminate time on the NIH Web site, was subsequently removed and replaced with wording claiming “validity” for ADHD.)

In 2002, Castellanos et al. published the one and only MRI study of an ADHD-untreated group. However, because the ADHD-untreated patients were two years younger than the controls, the study was invalid, leaving stimulant treatment, not the never-validated disorder, ADHD, the likely cause of the brain atrophy.

In 2002, Daniel Weinberger, of the National Institute of Mental Health, claimed “major psychiatric diseases” are associated with “subtle but objectively characterizable changes” but could reference not a single proof (quoted in)

In 2002, the Advertisement Commission of Holland  determined that the claim that ADHD is an inborn brain dysfunction was misleading and enjoined the Brain Foundation of the Netherlands to cease such representations.

In 2003, Ireland prohibited GlaxoSmithKline from claiming that the antidepressant Paxil “works by bringing serotonin levels back to normal.” Wayne Goodman of the FDA acknowledged that claims that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors correct a serotonin imbalance go “too far,” but had the temerity to suggest that “this is reasonable shorthand for expressing a chemically or brain-based problem” (quoted in

At an FDA hearing on March 23, 2006, I testified: “Saying any psychiatric diagnosis ‘is a brain-based problem and that the medications are normalizing function’ is an anti-scientific, pro-drug lie” Yet this has become standard practice throughout medicine, for example, at the American Psychiatric Association American Medical Association , American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Academy of Pediatrics, Child Neurology Society, American Academy of Family Physicians FDA and virtually all US government health-care agencies.

Journal articles , press releases, ads , drug inserts, and research informed consent documents say, or infer, that psychological diagnoses are abnormalities/diseases. All patients and research participants with psychological problems are led to believe they have an abnormality/disease, biasing them in favor of medical interventions, and against nonmedical interventions (e.g., love, will power, or talk therapy), which presume, as is the case, that the individual is physically and medically normal and without need of a medical/pharmaceutical intervention.

The FDA is the agency most responsible for conveying the facts needed by the public to make risk versus benefit and informed consent decisions. Instead—by protecting industry, not the public—the FDA is a purveyor of the psychiatric “disease” and “chemical imbalance” lie. This must change.

8zorxr,"I've been on citalopram for 36 days, and ever since I titrated up to 20mg 11 days ago I'm so exhausted that I instinctively lie down as soon as I'm done standing, instead of sitting, so I can recover from standing. I only can manage standing for short periods to do things I have to like clean the litter box or prepare food, then I collapse on my back again, exhausted. Also, the citalopram has reduced my blood pressure, it used to be in the 90s now it's always in the 80s. 

My question is would adding a small amount of Wellbutrin, like 75 mg or half of that give me back the energy that citalopram takes away? Also, does Wellbutrin increase heart rate? I ask because I already take adderall and it increases my heart rate more than ideal already so I'm wondering if Wellbutrin does the same because it's an ""energizing "" antidepressant? I tried Wellbutrin 9 years ago but I was immediately put on 300mg and I had a VERY bad reaction. Later I tried cutting that in half , and then into quarters ( so 75mg) and I still felt the beginnings of extreme agitation coming on, which is why I wonder about cutting the lowest dose in half.

Unfortunately, the Vraylar seems makes my blood sugar spike (130s up to 180s, so far).

I discontinued use when it first happened, and contacted my pshrink.  Since I'm more functional with Vraylar than I had been in literally decades, we decided to continue use and and I would start taking metformin.  It doesn't seem to have much of an effect, though - this morning I clocked in at 137 - too high.

This is depressing because I do not want to go back to wondering when my manic rage is going to make me look like an idiot.   I'd rather develop full-blown diabetes than go back to that.

8z8ymc,"Hey guyssss 

So I can’t stay asleep for 8 hours, that’s all there is to it. My body just fucking won’t do it. I wake up every 2 hours during the night and I need about 10-12 per night to feel well rested. 

So my doctor prescribed trazodone to help me sleep. It’s a miracle worker. However, it’s constipating the shit out of me, no PUN INTENDED (except a lil bit) 

So I thought maybe if it builds up in your system like melatonin does I could take it every other night and maybe still sleep well. 

WELL ITS 3:35 AM AND IM AWAKE SO HI GUYS. 

I take 800mg of magnesium because I have weird IBS symptoms anyway, and that usually works for me. Well now I’m barely going to the bathroom. I don’t know what to do to even stuff out. 

Does anyone else have this problem? To be honest I’d rather sleep poorly and be able to poop, but in an ideal world shouldn’t the average human be able to do both? Is this too much to ask?!?? ",constipation

I'm worried that I will be held accountable for someone else's mistake.

I did the visual verification and counseled the patient. The drug was supposed to be trazodone, but the tech typed in tramadol. The other pharmacist apparently just blew through it quickly and approved it. When I counseled the patient I mentioned that it's used for pain and can cause drowsiness. He said he knew all about it.

How does liability work in this situation? I'm in California if that matters.

8yppoo,"About 5 months back a really hard year all caught up with me at once, from losing family members, pets, my car and a dozen other small disaster, then my wife nearly died and was in ICU for over a month just after the holidays, but she recovered and we started getting back to normal life.

And I was still doing okay. Or so I thought. I got the flu and couldn't take care of things and suddenly it all hit at once. I spent a month in bed, not just because I was sick but because any little thing started setting off panic attacks like I've never experienced. I saw my shower floor was dirty and needed to be scrubbed and *that* sent me into hyperventilating panic because it felt like added pressure to take care of things. 

I fell off the wagon after 8-years sober, started drinking again, which made everything worse. I'd drink just to be able to make phone calls and work and take care of responsibilities. The surge that alcohol gave me let me get shit done, but as soon as it wore off I would feel worse than before, so it became a cycle. 

I made the hard call and made an appointment with my old psychiatrist and counseling center, but they were backed up *four months* and they were actually less booked than other doctors in my town.

So finally, here I am. It's day two of getting on Prozac and Trazodone (a sedative and mood-booster) and I'm just reeling. Like last time I tried meds (Zoloft) it worked immediately. I feel the anxiety slipping away, I don't feel like tiny things are going to send me spiraling into panic and crushing sadness. It's not totally better yet, but it's a HUUUUGE difference. I feel like I just got back from a war, I'm breathing deep and looking around my house like a stranger.

I'm groggy as all hell, my stomach is upset and I'm sensitive to sunlight, but most of that will pass as my body adjusts. I don't feel the urge to drink. I don't feel like hiding in bed all day and I slept about 11 hours last night, after months of barely sleeping at all.

I'm getting better. It's going to be work still to retrain my brain back to getting out of fight-or-flight mode at any stress, but it will be easier now.

If you haven't considered it, do yourself a favor and get help. It doesn't always work right away for everyone, and sometimes you need to go down a list of doctors and meds before you find a good fit, but you have to start somewhere.",panic

If you haven't considered it, do yourself a favor and get help. It doesn't always work right away for everyone, and sometimes you need to go down a list of doctors and meds before you find a good fit, but you have to start somewhere.",sensitive to sunlight

    So I'm a 21 yr old female. i grew up in a house with a very physically and sexually abusive stepfather and my mom. When I was in 3rd grade my mom developed a drug problem and then that led to an alcohol problem..eventually I was able to get out of there and I've been ""hot-potatoed"" around everyone in my family and never really knew what stability was...my mom remained in my life but she was in and out rehab..when she was sober she was absolutely amazing, but every time she relapsed she was just a completely different person. I've always struggled with really bad depression and anxiety...I lost my mom unexpectedly 2 years ago to drugs and it flipped my whole world upside down. Ever since she died I feel like my life has been put on pause...right after her death I fell into a nasty drug and alcohol addiction that got me kicked out of my dads house...i lost my job and I pushed everyone one away from me and I overdosed on drugs...and the thing is, I didnt even care...I still dont...I've been in therapy and I feel like I've tried everything to make myself feel better but I just feel so damn worthless...I wake up every morning wishing that I didn't...I'm clean now, I only take medicine I'm prescribed..I have to take adderall in the morning just so I have the energy to get out of bed in the morning and I take valium to come down from it and to control my anxiety. I also take trazodone to help me sleep because I have PTSD and get horrible nightmares from my childhood where I wake up in the middle of the night sweating and shaking and crying...I've fixed the relationship with everyone in my family but nothings the same..maybe it's just me...but my family just doesn't feel like a family anymore...like wound that healed but left nothing but scar tissue...please reddit users, or anybody reading this...I need help, I need advice, I need something...anything...I feel so worthless and pathetic and like a waste of space...thank you to anyone who took the time to read this and to everyone who replies...

8y4jdy,"This all just started happening out of blue around early May. I woke up and went to work after what I thought was a good night's rest, when my body started feeling unnaturally weak and tired and this triggered a panic attack where it felt like I was going to pass out and die. I went to the doctor and had vitals/blood test done but nothing abnormal was found. I think this event started causing my brain to associate the feelings of fatigue with ""you're gonna pass out and die"" and thus I now have sleep anxiety.

No matter how tired I am, whenever I go to bed I feel any combination of the following symptoms:

- Mild body tremors; almost like I'm shivering regardless if it's cold or not.
- Increased heart rate/heart palpitations.
- ""Brain Craziness"" It feels like my body is exhausted, but my head is buzzing with craziness.
- Head Pressure/Tension Headache
- Body/Head Heaviness when my body is extra tired; ironically it makes it harder to sleep in this case.
- Struggle to think about stuff or concentrate on anything. Back when I could sleep normally I was able to do this with no problem.
- Occasional nauseousness.

I've tried a few sleep medications to try and alleviate this problem:

- Unisom/Nyquil/Benedrill - Don't do crap and just make me wake an hour or so after going to sleep with a panic attack and drowsiness.

- Hydroxyzine - Same effects as the above drug.

- Melatonin - Doesn't seem to do anything.

- Ambien (1.5mg) - This works but it makes me very tired all day the next day and I'm unable to be productive or go to work even on such a low dosage. Also I'm not sure if this even works anymore after last night as I ended up waking up earlier than usual.

- Trazodone (12mg) - This seemed like it was my savior drug for a few weeks and I was able to live a relatively normal life and go back to work because of this, but it gave me tension headaches randomly throughout the day and dry mouth during the night, but those side effects seem to have stopped and have been replaced with nausea for an entire day and it doesn't seem to really help me sleep anymore.

8xxeqe,"So, where do I start. OK,  I’ll start with telling you all my name and why, after 11 years of living with depression, I have decided to start a journal. So here goes. My name is Scott and I am 22 Years of age, I have had depression since I was 11 years old. I have decided to write this journal as a means of releasing my emotions and to show others that they are not alone. OK so now that we have the introductions out of the way, I will explain why I’m am still awake at, as of writing this part of the paragraph, 05:15am. I have a really bad habit of dwelling on the negatives of my past and it just so happens that today that negative is my biological farther ( or as I like to call him, my sperm donor ). I went to put my head down to try and sleep, then all of a sudden he comes flying into my brain. So I check his Facebook.  I start scrolling through his wall and stumble across a post from the 31st of may. Yeah big deal you found a post, I know it sounds trivial but the post was a memorial to my grandmother. I didn’t even know she had passed away. Naturally I got quite upset that nobody had informed me. So I decided to check on other family members’ walls to see when the funeral was. I couldn’t find anything, not even a post to say she had passed. So I kept scrolling, thinking ‘ well I might as well see what they are doing with their lives’. Deeper and deeper I go, passing birthday wishes and trivial posts, then it happens, a post from the 23rd of march, letting their friends know that my grandmother had passed away and the funeral would be on the 30th. It was line a ton of bricks had fell on me all at once. She passed away 3 months ago. 3 months and none of my paternal family even had the decency to tell me or invite me to the funeral. It made me so angry . Then sad. I just sat staring at the post for what seemed like hours. Dark thoughts running through my head. Thoughts telling me to do things that I don’t want to do. Telling me that I am worthless and a waste of space. Then the monsters came. Backing me into a corner. Laughing and taunting me.... this happens a lot, the monsters. It is the visual I get in my head when I have an episode. Big scary monsters surrounding me, visualised as a small child, my only weapon is a broken stick that does nothing against them. Them cackling and taunting, attacking me with their sharp claws. Ripping away at my flesh till I’m nothing but a pulsating mound of bone and flesh. Left to rot away. I’m sorry for the graphic imagery but there is no better way to convey the pain and torment in my head. It’s now at the point where I’m losing what little grasp I have left on reality. I’ve seen a doctor and other medical professionals but they are no use. All they do is sit there and say ‘ and how does that make you feel’. What use is that, I need guidance. I need someone to be there and help me fight the monsters. Not ask me how things make me fucking feel. I’ll tell you how it makes me feel. It makes me feel like ending it all. It makes me feel like you are a waste of time. Getting paid to ask the same question over and over again. Pretending to care, when really all you see is a big money bag sitting there. Are you even listening to me or is all you hear the sound of pound coins jingling and bank notes rustling. And don’t get me started on the drugs they give you. Trazodone 50mg, take one at night. May cause drowsiness. Yeah no shit. They turn you into a Fucking zombie. They don’t get rid of the pain. They make it worse. They take what little humanity you have left. Then you tell your doctor and they just fob you off “ take them for another couple weeks and come back”. Bitch I don’t Ned to take them for longer l. I know what they are doing to me now. How would you like it if I just took the whole box. Oh wait yeah that’s right.  You wouldn’t care would you. It doesn’t affect you. As long as you still get paid and get to go home to your cushy little life. Well fuck you. I’m sorry but I need to get this off my chest. I honestly don’t want to be here anymore. Everyday is a struggle. A fight against the desire to end it. But I can’t. I’m fucking coward. I want to be dead but I don’t have the balls to do anything about it. Then when you try and vent on social media, you get people saying things like: “ why are you depressed for. You shouldn’t be” and “ I’m here to talk if you need me” but they never are. You try and talk to them but they just run away or call you stupid for having bad thoughts. Or they tell you to go to a doctor or see a councillor . Don’t you think I’ve already tried? Then you start staying in bed all day. No energy to move. No strength left to face the day. But that only makes things worse. Your family start calling you lazy. They don’t care that you are on the verge of a full on break down. To them you are a waste of space. A burden. A failure. Then you have bottle of vodka in your right hand and a box of pills in your left. Ready to do it. But you can’t. You know that if you do it won’t solve anything. Your family will just call you selfish. They will judge you even after death....
The time is now 06:15am.  I’m still unable to sleep. The more I write the angrier I get. My brain is going into overdrive. The negative thoughts getting more and more twisted. My weapon is gone now. My last defence, as useless as it was, a pile of dust on the floor. The monsters bigger and meaner. They don’t laugh at you now. Or taunt. They just glare at you. Their eyes burning into to as they slowly tear away at your flesh. Reaching inside of you.  Destroying what is left of your frail body. Till there is nothing. Not a trace. But the monsters don’t go. They stay. Still glaring. Eyes fixed on the spot where the disembowelled you. And then you come back. Poof. And it starts all over again the monsters feasting once again. You feel it will never stop. An endless cycle.

8zcf8d,"**Phenibut** same - it's a very, very unique product,  often repeat, is a good substitute - an alternative to supplements,  because its tranquilizing properties are quite within 1500-2000mg / day,  but there is no side effects, and memory indicators of intelligence in  general only improve. If addicts have nothing to take, they OCCASIONALLY  Phenibut abuse, which, of course, at high doses, leads to the formation  of dependence is very mild. Often it is not required to facilitate  specific drug withdrawal. Phenibut, I repeat again, it is one of the few  neuroprotective drugs, has no side effects like Piracetam, etc.  (agitation, insomnia, etc.) - so Phenibutum very popular. Adding it to  the treatment regimen of mental disorders significantly reduces the dose  of antipsychotic drugs, biological supplements and other medicines, and  thus eliminates the side effects Phenibutum ""heavy drugs"". A unique  product that has no analogues in the world. And the fact that many  doctors do not know how to use it properly, and drug addicts sometimes  abuse them - it is clear how to grams peas. And even more clear  ignorance of many ""Psychiatrists"" in relation to Phenibut - they are, I  repeat, we must be able to use.

Phenibutum actually promotes  rejection of depression since the first dose. It helps to maintain  physical activity and overloads, Phenotropil is a littleall the same.  But ... in conditions of psychological stress preferred the latter.  Several noticeable mood-elevating effect of this nootropic that is not  always necessary. Overall, a very decent product - not expecting.

Introduction  into the molecule of the fatty GABA phenyl radical Phenibut converts it  into a preparation. This radical GABA easily penetrates into the brain  and has a strong inhibitory action (which is characteristic of this  acid).  
 GABA also exerts nootropic effect (it is mandatory participant in many metabolic processes in the brain).

**What do you think about course combination Phenibut and Pantogam (say Pantogam course lasts, and for 2-3 weeks joins Phenibut)?**

To  reduce the irritating effect on the mucous membrane of the digestive  tract Phenibut had to take gastrofarm, with a clear action Phenibut I  have not seen.

Before taking phenibut need a square meal, a good  anxiolytic, good support in stressful situations, but slows down  response time.

In general, I have absolutely no interest in the use of recreational [Phenibut](http://drdoping.com/shop/phenibut/)  not interested as to develop the use of ad hoc, most want to know is  about the use of foreign exchange, as I expressed astenik with a  combination of fatigue and at the same time quite strong generalized  anxiety.  
 

I know a lot of stimulants, some of them tried Enerion  the same way, foreign exchange reception very nice reduces fatigue -  BUT! - My whip in the first place - the anxiety, uncertainty, stiffness,  severe vegetative reactions sometimes the most innocuous anxiogenic  stimuli (call the client at work, resolution of operational problems,  etc.) - vega rushing, by leaps and bounds: the pulse quickens 3 sekndy  and a half times, sweating, subjective sense of increasing blood  pressure.  
 

I want it to get out of it completely. Symptom of a  watch for about 7 years (21 years for this day, 28 years), and watch it  in the steady development. Shoveled tons of material for nootropics,  tranquilizers, psychostimulants, etc. Many have tried, but their main  problem - the alarm and a monstrous reflection - to win can not. I  think, and fatigue grows from here.  
 

He was engaged not only in  self, was the doctors. In addition to the procedures and the regime (by  the way, involved in athletics, I love warm baths, etc. - helps only  during the procedure, from start to finish: got out of the bath / jumped  off the treadmill - Symptoms go into growth again)  
 doctors prescribed: 1) Pantogam 2) Medazepam.  
 

 Medazepam tried (although he knew what the charm) - by itself, Tupelo,  and sexual life left in the realm of fantasy. Naturally, from the BDT he  refused. By the way, I tried Grandaxinum - about anything.  
 

 Pantogam begin to accept and finish, more than 3 months did not take any  time - yes, some effect is, again, starting with doses of 2g (8  tablets) per day, but more or less serious anxiogenic environment (and I  Manager active sales) effect is somewhere far away, faint background.

You  write that your main problem is ""anxiety, uncertainty, stiffness,  monstrous reflection, and hence fatigue."" So I do not see in this case,  the indications for admission nootropics. You yourself write that you  have tried many things, but the condition is getting worse, ""a symptom  watch for about 7 years (21 years for this day, 28 years), and watch it  in the steady development."" Therefore, it may make sense to discuss with  your doctor the inclusion in the scheme of treatment of antidepressants  and tranquilizers?

I took sertraline (Stimuloton) 200 mg / day.  Yes, the mood in general is increased, more energy - but! - Anxiety  remained still, fatigue, in principle, too. Thus, in general,  antidepressant influenced only general background mood. (NB Before  taking Sertraline Fluoxetine 2 months - went to Sertalin because of  sedation, which is produced in the fluoxetine me).  
 

I would take  Sertraline further, but left (descended gradually decreasing doses of  ""ladder"") due to the negative effect of too, which he made on libido,  erection and sensitivity, up to anorgasmia. (By the way, occasionally (3  weeks) tried mono bupropion, yes, of course, in the sexual sphere it  acts only positive, but - crazy aggression, impulsivity, anxiety  generally passed into paranoia ....)  
 

In general, empirically  observed that the most positive impact on the complex I have only  nootropics, but in different ways. Of course, Timo-analeptic effect of  sertraline is beyond competition.

What's to argue Phenibutum  popular among the people and is sold without a prescription. How to love  to joke with the reception thereof nootropic becoming give a damn :)  hence the root Phenibutum. But seriously Phenibutum suppresses anxiety,  relieves asthenia, energizing, acting a little Wegetotropona, enhances  the antidepressive effect in TCA - prices were not, would this  nootropics, but unlike Phenotropil - reduces attention and slows  reaction.

I take Phenibut for week, there is a strong effect, but I  just have not tried before. You can draw an analogy to its action of  bupropion, only changing the negative to the positive.  
 

Bupropion is also based on phenyl-ethylamine structure (this is just for reference).  
 

However, personally from bupropion I watched the monstrous aggression and destructive thinking.  
 From Phenibut - quite the opposite, I would call it a strong empathogen.  
 

 Phenibut acc. the law should be sold strictly on prescription. It  should be noted that for him now follow stricter than many other funds,  stricter than fluoxetine (eg., Profluzak). And I readily understand why,  because Profluzak (when I took it - the doctor wrote 1.5 years ago)  almost makes man God's dandelion. Then the action is much more difficult  Phenibut.  
 

I for myself have now understood why the whole  attitude towards Nootropil skeptical - as compared to all other Phenibut  nootropics (and I have tried almost everything, trying to get out of  troubling asthenia) - compared to him they - vitamin C in the degree of  impact on the psyche.  
 

Moreover, now I would recommend to treat  it much neater. Yes, positive, but very, very strange ... I do not know  what will happen, but it seems to me that the first time my personality  changes, and much more so than it has been in the treatment of other  nootropics, DB, antidepressants (fluoxetine and sertraline (at a time,  one had to change to another) - on doctor's advice).  
 

I  currently find it difficult to give a general description of this  change. Of course, I notice a significant reduction asthenic effects  (weakness, fatigue), as well as anxiety, but I think it gives a certain  price, though, I repeat, I can not say for sure, strategically change  negative or positive.  
 

I can only assure you that the anti-social effects, drug aggression is not exactly in this respect it is safe.

You  write that your main problem is ""anxiety, uncertainty, stiffness,  monstrous reflection, and hence fatigue."" So I do not see in this case,  the indications for admission nootropics. You yourself write that you  have tried many things, but the condition is getting worse, ""a symptom  watch for about 7 years (21 years for this day, 28 years), and watch it  in the steady development."" Therefore, it may make sense to discuss with  your doctor the inclusion in the scheme of treatment of antidepressants  and tranquilizers?

I took sertraline (Stimuloton) 200 mg / day.  Yes, the mood in general is increased, more energy - but! - Anxiety  remained still, fatigue, in principle, too. Thus, in general,  antidepressant influenced only general background mood. (NB Before  taking Sertraline Fluoxetine 2 months - went to Sertalin because of  sedation, which is produced in the fluoxetine me).  
 

I would take  Sertraline further, but left (descended gradually decreasing doses of  ""ladder"") due to the negative effect of too, which he made on libido,  erection and sensitivity, up to anorgasmia. (By the way, occasionally (3  weeks) tried mono bupropion, yes, of course, in the sexual sphere it  acts only positive, but - crazy aggression, impulsivity, anxiety  generally passed into paranoia ....)  
 

In general, empirically  observed that the most positive impact on the complex I have only  nootropics, but in different ways. Of course, Timo-analeptic effect of  sertraline is beyond competition.

What's to argue Phenibutum  popular among the people and is sold without a prescription. How to love  to joke with the reception thereof nootropic becoming give a damn :)  hence the root Phenibutum. But seriously Phenibutum suppresses anxiety,  relieves asthenia, energizing, acting a little Wegetotropona, enhances  the antidepressive effect in TCA - prices were not, would this  nootropics, but unlike Phenotropil - reduces attention and slows  reaction.

I take Phenibut for week, there is a strong effect, but I  just have not tried before. You can draw an analogy to its action of  bupropion, only changing the negative to the positive.  
 

Bupropion is also based on phenyl-ethylamine structure (this is just for reference).  
 

However, personally from bupropion I watched the monstrous aggression and destructive thinking.  
 From Phenibut - quite the opposite, I would call it a strong empathogen.  
 

 Phenibut acc. the law should be sold strictly on prescription. It  should be noted that for him now follow stricter than many other funds,  stricter than fluoxetine (eg., Profluzak). And I readily understand why,  because Profluzak (when I took it - the doctor wrote 1.5 years ago)  almost makes man God's dandelion. Then the action is much more difficult  Phenibut.  
 

I for myself have now understood why the whole  attitude towards Nootropil skeptical - as compared to all other Phenibut  nootropics (and I have tried almost everything, trying to get out of  troubling asthenia) - compared to him they - vitamin C in the degree of  impact on the psyche.  
 

Moreover, now I would recommend to treat  it much neater. Yes, positive, but very, very strange ... I do not know  what will happen, but it seems to me that the first time my personality  changes, and much more so than it has been in the treatment of other  nootropics, DB, antidepressants (fluoxetine and sertraline (at a time,  one had to change to another) - on doctor's advice).  
 

I  currently find it difficult to give a general description of this  change. Of course, I notice a significant reduction asthenic effects  (weakness, fatigue), as well as anxiety, but I think it gives a certain  price, though, I repeat, I can not say for sure, strategically change  negative or positive.  
 

I can only assure you that the anti-social effects, drug aggression is not exactly in this respect it is safe.

 GABA also exerts nootropic effect (it is mandatory participant in many metabolic processes in the brain).

**What do you think about course combination Phenibut and Pantogam (say Pantogam course lasts, and for 2-3 weeks joins Phenibut)?**

To  reduce the irritating effect on the mucous membrane of the digestive  tract Phenibut had to take gastrofarm, with a clear action Phenibut I  have not seen.

Before taking phenibut need a square meal, a good  anxiolytic, good support in stressful situations, but slows down  response time.

In general, I have absolutely no interest in the use of recreational [Phenibut](http://drdoping.com/shop/phenibut/)  not interested as to develop the use of ad hoc, most want to know is  about the use of foreign exchange, as I expressed astenik with a  combination of fatigue and at the same time quite strong generalized  anxiety.  
 

I know a lot of stimulants, some of them tried Enerion  the same way, foreign exchange reception very nice reduces fatigue -  BUT! - My whip in the first place - the anxiety, uncertainty, stiffness,  severe vegetative reactions sometimes the most innocuous anxiogenic  stimuli (call the client at work, resolution of operational problems,  etc.) - vega rushing, by leaps and bounds: the pulse quickens 3 sekndy  and a half times, sweating, subjective sense of increasing blood  pressure.  
 

I want it to get out of it completely. Symptom of a  watch for about 7 years (21 years for this day, 28 years), and watch it  in the steady development. Shoveled tons of material for nootropics,  tranquilizers, psychostimulants, etc. Many have tried, but their main  problem - the alarm and a monstrous reflection - to win can not. I  think, and fatigue grows from here.  
 

He was engaged not only in  self, was the doctors. In addition to the procedures and the regime (by  the way, involved in athletics, I love warm baths, etc. - helps only  during the procedure, from start to finish: got out of the bath / jumped  off the treadmill - Symptoms go into growth again)  
 doctors prescribed: 1) Pantogam 2) Medazepam.  
 

 Medazepam tried (although he knew what the charm) - by itself, Tupelo,  and sexual life left in the realm of fantasy. Naturally, from the BDT he  refused. By the way, I tried Grandaxinum - about anything.  
 

 Pantogam begin to accept and finish, more than 3 months did not take any  time - yes, some effect is, again, starting with doses of 2g (8  tablets) per day, but more or less serious anxiogenic environment (and I  Manager active sales) effect is somewhere far away, faint background.

You  write that your main problem is ""anxiety, uncertainty, stiffness,  monstrous reflection, and hence fatigue."" So I do not see in this case,  the indications for admission nootropics. You yourself write that you  have tried many things, but the condition is getting worse, ""a symptom  watch for about 7 years (21 years for this day, 28 years), and watch it  in the steady development."" Therefore, it may make sense to discuss with  your doctor the inclusion in the scheme of treatment of antidepressants  and tranquilizers?

I took sertraline (Stimuloton) 200 mg / day.  Yes, the mood in general is increased, more energy - but! - Anxiety  remained still, fatigue, in principle, too. Thus, in general,  antidepressant influenced only general background mood. (NB Before  taking Sertraline Fluoxetine 2 months - went to Sertalin because of  sedation, which is produced in the fluoxetine me).  
 

I would take  Sertraline further, but left (descended gradually decreasing doses of  ""ladder"") due to the negative effect of too, which he made on libido,  erection and sensitivity, up to anorgasmia. (By the way, occasionally (3  weeks) tried mono bupropion, yes, of course, in the sexual sphere it  acts only positive, but - crazy aggression, impulsivity, anxiety  generally passed into paranoia ....)  
 

In general, empirically  observed that the most positive impact on the complex I have only  nootropics, but in different ways. Of course, Timo-analeptic effect of  sertraline is beyond competition.

What's to argue Phenibutum  popular among the people and is sold without a prescription. How to love  to joke with the reception thereof nootropic becoming give a damn :)  hence the root Phenibutum. But seriously Phenibutum suppresses anxiety,  relieves asthenia, energizing, acting a little Wegetotropona, enhances  the antidepressive effect in TCA - prices were not, would this  nootropics, but unlike Phenotropil - reduces attention and slows  reaction.

I take Phenibut for week, there is a strong effect, but I  just have not tried before. You can draw an analogy to its action of  bupropion, only changing the negative to the positive.  
 

Bupropion is also based on phenyl-ethylamine structure (this is just for reference).  
 

However, personally from bupropion I watched the monstrous aggression and destructive thinking.  
 From Phenibut - quite the opposite, I would call it a strong empathogen.  
 

 Phenibut acc. the law should be sold strictly on prescription. It  should be noted that for him now follow stricter than many other funds,  stricter than fluoxetine (eg., Profluzak). And I readily understand why,  because Profluzak (when I took it - the doctor wrote 1.5 years ago)  almost makes man God's dandelion. Then the action is much more difficult  Phenibut.  
 

I for myself have now understood why the whole  attitude towards Nootropil skeptical - as compared to all other Phenibut  nootropics (and I have tried almost everything, trying to get out of  troubling asthenia) - compared to him they - vitamin C in the degree of  impact on the psyche.  
 

Moreover, now I would recommend to treat  it much neater. Yes, positive, but very, very strange ... I do not know  what will happen, but it seems to me that the first time my personality  changes, and much more so than it has been in the treatment of other  nootropics, DB, antidepressants (fluoxetine and sertraline (at a time,  one had to change to another) - on doctor's advice).  
 

I  currently find it difficult to give a general description of this  change. Of course, I notice a significant reduction asthenic effects  (weakness, fatigue), as well as anxiety, but I think it gives a certain  price, though, I repeat, I can not say for sure, strategically change  negative or positive.  
 

I can only assure you that the anti-social effects, drug aggression is not exactly in this respect it is safe.  
 

 But the fact that it is often prescribed to children ... I was puzzled  and confused now that I feel in myself these changes. I would not  recommend prescribed the drug during the formation of the central  nervous system.  
 

But the fact that the drug is definitely  powerful, I can confirm (based on my extensive experience in the  treatment of a placebo effect can not be considered - not only admit to  the second reception at the beginning of the course I felt no small  skepticism with regard to the drug - of course , expected effect, but  suggested that it would be slender like Pantogam).

8zcf8d,"**Phenibut** same - it's a very, very unique product,  often repeat, is a good substitute - an alternative to supplements,  because its tranquilizing properties are quite within 1500-2000mg / day,  but there is no side effects, and memory indicators of intelligence in  general only improve. If addicts have nothing to take, they OCCASIONALLY  Phenibut abuse, which, of course, at high doses, leads to the formation  of dependence is very mild. Often it is not required to facilitate  specific drug withdrawal. Phenibut, I repeat again, it is one of the few  neuroprotective drugs, has no side effects like Piracetam, etc.  (agitation, insomnia, etc.) - so Phenibutum very popular. Adding it to  the treatment regimen of mental disorders significantly reduces the dose  of antipsychotic drugs, biological supplements and other medicines, and  thus eliminates the side effects Phenibutum ""heavy drugs"". A unique  product that has no analogues in the world. And the fact that many  doctors do not know how to use it properly, and drug addicts sometimes  abuse them - it is clear how to grams peas. And even more clear  ignorance of many ""Psychiatrists"" in relation to Phenibut - they are, I  repeat, we must be able to use.

Phenibutum actually promotes  rejection of depression since the first dose. It helps to maintain  physical activity and overloads, Phenotropil is a littleall the same.  But ... in conditions of psychological stress preferred the latter.  Several noticeable mood-elevating effect of this nootropic that is not  always necessary.

8ypcuy,"I have been diagnosed with bipolar two and inattentive adhd. I'm a male. I'm thirty one years old. Because of my financial situation I depend upon the services of my counties free clinic. My psydoc has prescribed fluoxetine, a prozac generic, however the clinic does not prescribe adderall because of addiction issues in the community. I have not been prescribed a mood stabalizer for reasons that are not clear to me. (It is difficult to get information because demand for a psydocs services so exceed supply that my last appointment lasted between five and ten minutes and my next appointment is in October. There is only time to ask one question, at best.)

My story would probably be familiar to many of you. Failed several grades in public high school but finally graduated. Went to community college, flunked out. Took some time to get myself together and decide what I wanted to do, grow up a bit and get serious about life and a career. Went back to community college. Flunked out. 

Employment history is much the same. Eventually I just stop showing up or I am terminated because minor mistakes accumulate to the point they seriously inconvenience my employer. 

Over the years I have slowly given up on my dreams. In my younger years I believed I could overcome my challenges and live a meaningful life. At thirty one years old I no longer believe this. There are non-fiscal, non-career/educational goals which are important to me in deeply meaningful ways however I am unable to make progress on those goals for the same reasons that I was unable to be successful in school.

It would be accurate to say that I am suicidal however this does not provide a full picture of my thoughts. It is not just that I want to die, it is that I do not have hope for a meaningful life and I do not enjoy life due to the challenges of bipolar and adhd. Today, at thirty one years old and after medication and treatment my life is worse than it was unmedicated and untreated at twenty one. Will forty one be any better? I see a number of reasons that it could but they are low percentile bets at best. I could win the lottery or be the beneficiary of a miracle cure after an astonishing breakthrough in the field of mental health. But it seems more likely that my situation will continue down the path it has been upon for the last ten years. 

I see no reason to endure this future when there is no prize awaiting me at the end. The reward for suffering is more suffering. This suffering is without meaning; there is no purpose to my life, despite my attempts to give it meaning. What is the case for the future? ",addiction

8xxvkz,"Fluoxetine (prozac) doesn't seems to work for me and I'm not particularly keen to return for the follow up appt in a month's time. I tried to seek professional help as advised by others, but it just didn't turn out the way I expected. Or to be more precise, it flopped as I feared. After contemplating hard yesterday and struggling through the suicidal thoughts alone, I have decided to end everything in October when everyone goes overseas for their vacation and I'm free to carry out my plan. 

What should I do in my remaining time? I don't really have anything on my list since I have been waiting to die since a year ago. It just feels extremely stupid to keep saying that I'm dying then I didn't die. Everyone tells me I'm strong, a good guy, I will get through then they all just leave me alone. In the first place, why do ppl only react hard when someone is dying? If said person does not die, he doesn't need anything? Why? Because his strong? What's strong anyway? Cause I can do pull ups? Sigh... I'm both frustrated and tired but I'm finding peace in that things will finally end soon.

8xwsrg,"Hello everyone! 

I have been living with close to intolerable depression for several years (most likely inherited from my mother) and only recently spoke with a psychiatrist about possible treatment and also for the sake of telling someone what I was (and still am) experiencing. She then presribed me 20 mg of fluoxetine every day and I am almost three weeks into this regime.

I can't say I hate fluoxetine, but I certainly don't enjoy it. While I no longer lay in bed all day imagining how to kill myself while doing the least emotional damage to those around me, I do lay in bed all day and think about nothing while simultaneously feeling no emotions. I take no joy from things I like to do, I feel much less hatred for myself, and I don't have any interest in doing anything in the slightest.

I feel like a hollowed out version of myself, just one that doesn't fantasize about death. I hate the way antidepressants put me into a haze and limit my ability to just simply think. Do any of you have experience with fluoxetine or similar SSRI's lowering your overall quality of life despite diminishing intrusive thoughts?

Thank you and I hope you have a good night. Peace.",haze
8zvc7a,"I am a serial-quitter, unfortunately. Must have 'quit' 50 times in the last one year. Never lasted more than 6 days with 2 days being the average. After which the urge for ""Just one puff"" has caused me to spiral back into the smoking trap.

I first tried quitting last year after reading Allen Carr's book. Needless to say, the book worked like magic and by the time I finished it I was up and ready to quit the same day. 

Mistake 1: I did not quit the same day. I waited for some meaningless day after a week to signify the end of my smoking stint. 

The problem with this is that by setting a quit date, I made it feel smoking is an important (good or bad) part of my life. The constant feeling of ""giving up"" and the last cigarette ceremony made me realize I did not actually comprehend the book completely.

So I read Allen's other book - The Only Way

This was a longer read, but nonetheless almost as effective as the first one. Focussed on points I missed during the first read. Took about a week to complete the book and I was up and ready to quit smoking again!

And I did for 3 days.

Mistake no. 2 : I upped my intake of weed to compensate the loss in nicotine. Bad bad decision. 

This can't be qualified as an attempt to quit as I just replaced nicotine with THC. Different drugs, different feeling, but the same problem. Addiction. 

The next quit attempt was fuelled by wife, who got so angry at me not sticking to my quit resolve that she almost, almost had to respect for me anymore. That hurt. 

So I quit again. This was the longest one. 6 days. You ask why 6 days? Because my wife went out of town for 3 days on the 7th day and I had a field day smoking and smoking up the entire fucking weekend hoping I'll quit once my wife is back and she wont know a thing. On Monday, I was sheepishly asking for cigarette from a friend at work. This quit attempt was the lowest point in my life.

Mistake 3: I did not plan my initial days of withdrawal. Had no clue what to do when home alone for 3 days. So stuck to my routine of smoking and smoking up.

Some other mistakes I've made:

1.Pushing the quit date by one day everyday to make it almost a year now
2. Getting distraught at the thought of not smoking at future events. I know this is stupid and its the nicotine speaking and not me
3. Lying to people, my wife especially. 
4. Getting influenced by others, especially co-workers at work

The list is long and I probably can write a book on how not to quit.

But, this time I feel it's different. 

I am tired of the constant battle in my mind - smoke, dont smoke

I am tired of the weakness in me calling for a cigarette everytime there's a small problem in my life

I am tired of lying to people, most importantly myself

I am just tired of quitting! 

I get a feel this is the last time I quit. Wish me luck guys :)

Also, my concoction didn't contain any alcohol or any other thing, the  last time I felt such a warth but without that sense of awareness and  clarity was when I had a go at a hydrocodone and ethanol(alcohol) rich  cup of lean/sizzurp, I didn't have codeine on hand so I did it like  that, I did vomit from that one while the thunjone rich plant  concentrate, with honey as well, for good taste, just made me transpire  and it went like a nice trip then a shitty one when I finished up the  250 ml of it or 350 ml, but yeah, it made me transpire like shit and I  lost plenty of weight from that tbh, I went from 78.5 down to 74 or 75  kilograms from that night to the other, and my fever did go away, I  drank it since I didn't have any way of stopping my fever and that did  work out great, felt for the first few seconds like I was mentholating  my brain out of heat, but yeah, either way, I felt like that the next  day, but way toned down and a bit of the feeling remained for about a  week, when vaporizing thujone leafs, I did notice that it made my hands a  bit numb and made me more light headed, a thing that doesn't happen  when making a joint and smoking it, but when smoking thujone rich  leaves, it is harsh on the neck a lot like nicotine vaping or smoking.

Also, my concoction didn't contain any alcohol or any other thing, the  last time I felt such a warth but without that sense of awareness and  clarity was when I had a go at a hydrocodone and ethanol(alcohol) rich  cup of lean/sizzurp, I didn't have codeine on hand so I did it like  that, I did vomit from that one while the thunjone rich plant  concentrate, with honey as well, for good taste, just made me transpire  and it went like a nice trip then a shitty one when I finished up the  250 ml of it or 350 ml, but yeah, it made me transpire like shit and I  lost plenty of weight from that tbh, I went from 78.5 down to 74 or 75  kilograms from that night to the other, and my fever did go away, I  drank it since I didn't have any way of stopping my fever and that did  work out great, felt for the first few seconds like I was mentholating  my brain out of heat, but yeah, either way, I felt like that the next  day, but way toned down and a bit of the feeling remained for about a  week, when vaporizing thujone leafs, I did notice that it made my hands a  bit numb and made me more light headed, a thing that doesn't happen  when making a joint and smoking it, but when smoking thujone rich  leaves, it is harsh on the neck a lot like nicotine vaping or smoking.

8zlp9y,"Okay here we go, day 1! I've tried a few times before, and felt helpless after relapsing over and over again over the past several years. I've tried Champix (worked for 3 months), Easy Way (worked for 2 weeks), Nicoderm/Nicorette (worked for no longer than a week), but something was missing when I used these systems alone.

But a month ago, I came across a program at my local hospital where a counselor takes 7 smokers per month and hold 8 sessions of 90 minutes each, aimed at smoking cessation. I started 12 days ago, and quit date is on session 4, which is today. The first three sessions were to get us ready for what to experience, how to go about quitting, knowledge of the NRT products out there, but especially about the dangers of smoking and how addiction works. The counselor himself is an ex-smoker and has been giving this program for 14 years. This fact reduces my resistance to listening to him and helps me overcome my cognitive dissonance.

He said in the first session that if I were to see my doctor and get a prescription for a nicotine replacement product, my odds would be around 10% of being smoke-free that year. His rate of success among his 1800 graduates is 47%! 

The next 4 sessions will be support sessions about how to manage cravings, keeping ourselves motivated, and strategies to keep it permanent. Following that, he holds regular appointments with graduates, and support even after that first year. His program is loosely based on the American Lung Association's ""Freedom From Smoking"" program, which you can find online, if you don't have a health care provider who offers smoking cessation counseling in your area. If you're really serious, you won't go through this whole process alone. Quitting smoking is uncomfortable and you need everything in your corner in order to remain smoke-free.

It's not a ""scared straight"" type program. It's all about positive gains. I'm sure we've all been bombarded with comments that smoking causes 50 diseases, is expensive, smells bad, etc. So I wrote my positive affirmations on a post-it note and put that on my mirror:

1. No more slavery!
2. Prevent 50 diseases / Add 10 years to my life
3. Clear lungs, freedom from coughing
4. No more smelly clothes
5. Save $4000/year

I wish everyone luck in their journeys...or rather I wish everyone strength. Because it's a habit that you can kick, you just need to continuously be mindful of it. I, for one, am confident I'll finally kick this habit this time. But I need the support.",cravings

8zj1dc,"So a bit over 2 weeks ago, i finished a 40 pack of menthol cigarettes, they would last me 3-4 days. Every hour i'd be out for a puff, even in the middle of the night. Having trouble sleeping? Go out for a smoke. Cooking something? Turn down the heat and go out for a smoke. It consumed my life. For 7 years i smoked. 

I know i havent quit yet, its only been 2 weeks, but im determined to put smoking behind me. 

I've managed to replace cigarettes with vaping with 12mg e-juice but i've started mixing in no-nic e-juice at a 50-50 ratio to start weaning myself off nicotine. The hand-to-mouth motion of vaping has really helped me a lot. I know some ppl here dont like vaping but after trying gum, mints, patches, cold turkey and others this is the only one that seems to be working for me. 

I have a goal. By September i want to be down to only a few drops of nicotine e-juice per tank and by early next year down to no-nic e-juice only. 

I can already taste better, smell better, my clothes, hair & skin no longer smell horrible all the time and just yesterday at work i stepped outside for a vape and smelled my coworker's cigarette smoke. I was expecting it to set off my cravings, and it did a little which is what the vape was for, but more than that, i didn't like it. It smelled terrible. 

My hopes are high, given cigarette prices in australia, i've saved maybe a couple hundred dollars already. My vape is satisfying my cravings and i have no urges to buy more. 

I'll be sure to post more updates over time. Thanks for reading. ",cravings
8ziwvk,"Semi-rant incoming, don't have anyone else to talk and I need to get some of this out. 

Basically I was in love with her from the moment I saw her, but it took some time for her to come around to me, and we both made some mistakes in the beginning that started the relationship off rocky. But then we're good! For like 7 months straight we hung out all the time, doing whatever, and it was awesome. 

Then I hit some tough times financially, fell back into some drug habits, and things between her and I just started feeling worse and worse. I had been thinking of telling her I want to take a break for like two weeks before this weekend, which was her birthday. In my head I was like ""Ok, just act normal for the birthday, it'll be fine"" but it wasn't. I didn't put enough effort in and it showed. We got into a huge drunken fight on her birthday that ended with her pushing me, yelling at me, and ultimately me leaving after we fought through the night till 7am. 

The thing that sucks is knowing this is all my fault. If I were just more stable, more established in a career, and not addicted to fucking nicotine then her and I man, I feel like we could conquer the world. 

But yeah now she won't talk to me, possibly never will again, and I just don't know what to do or how to feel. Shit sucks.

Short story long. Day 14 of cold turkey after 22 years of cigs, and I’m totally curious on anyone else’s journey, and their experiences with anger that just appears out of nowhere.

It ebbs and flows, and now at day 14 it’s subsiding. I hope. Basically I snapped on the ones I care about the most(sadly, isn’t that the case?), but I would love to hear from anyone who has gone through this anger stage, and if you have any tips, advice, supplements, foods, anything for me/other’s dealing with this.

8zhc1m,"History:
Male

23

Overweight (27 BMI. Though caliper tests put me lower in terms of body fat, I'd still consider myself to be both strong and bigger than I need to be)

Drink 2-4 alcoholic beverages a week

Limit sugar intake on account of weight (1 or 2 12oz sodas a day, about two days a week of no sodas or sugar)

Physically active (not strenuously so) 2-3 hours a day. Typically walking/jogging up and down stairs

I have a vape, moderate nicotine levels

Urine indicates decent hydration

Urinate about 5-7 times daily

Bowel movements 2-3 times daily

Sexually active, but with the same partner for 5+ years 

Coffee, black, approx twice daily. Sometimes with milk, no sugar

Diet: Not the greatest. I try to eat plenty of vegetables (5-6 servings weekly, more with fruits) and don't eat out more than once weekly. Though often I cook things I probably shouldn't eat (Chicken parmesan, cheese burgers, frozen pizzas,etc). 

Fast for 16 hours daily

Water intake: Approx 48-72oz daily

Symptoms: 
For the last 24 hours, there has been an intermittent tingling/numbness in the soles of my feet, not painful but definitely noticable. No coldness as to indicate poor circulation. No frequent urination or other symptoms to indicate diabetes. Urine is rather pale and odor free, so I believe I am adequately hydrated. Sensation lasts about 6-12 hours, dies down for 2-3, then resurfaces.

8zglhg,"Hi. I'm writing this post to myself, though I'm sure some of you may relate. I'm on day 9 of my quit. This is my (many times attempt) at quit. I've gone for a long time, sometimes (like when I was pregnant and nursing.\[3x\]) Longest was 5 years. Then 2 years. Those were the longest periods. 

Started my first cigarette age 11. (Back in the day when I could actually GO to a liquor store at age 11 and buy a pack of cigarettes. No questions asked). That pisses me off.

So, one of the things I hear in my head as I quit is ""Hey... your friends/family will respect that you tried.. relapse is normal... you can always try again"". 

And, yeah, all that is true. But who does that serve? Ummm.. I think it serves BIG TOBACCO. And I think that's about it.

As one poster reminded me..""The solution to the problem is also the cause"". That is the formula for addiction. It's a big itch... it sucks... but there is no escape from it other than to stop feeding it!

I've been using EFT tapping to calm my cravings.. has been working pretty well.

Honestly, I'm still on the fence about giving in and making the excuse that ""I tried"". I'm hugely tempted every moment (especially in the evening) to dig some old butts out of the trash.

I've been smoking for roughly 40 years. My (20 year-old) daughter's dad (ex-husband) passed away this year from Prostate cancer. I want to be here for them as long as I can. Heck, I want to be here for ME and not just here, but HERE in a big way.. where I can be present and contributing to the planet. My addiction has cut my life in half (at least). And I'm not just talking about longevity, I'm talking about participation in LIFE on a day to day basis.

8zg4x0,"I am 24 years old and, up until 7 days ago, I smoked half a pack a day for about 6 years. I just want to thank everyone in this subreddit. This is a fantastic community, and it is the reason I have now gone 7 days without a cigarette and am totally confident that I will never have one again.

7 days ago, after browsing this sub for a while and inundating myself with all kinds of anti-smoking resources, I finally had my final cigarette. In fact, I soaked the remaining half a pack I had in my kitchen sink and tossed it!

I had gotten the gist of Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking from posts on this sub, but also ordered the book for myself and am currently about half way through it. The man is right on the money. I love the way he belittles smoking and nicotine to help his readers realize they are not the big scary monsters they are often made out to be. The reason I am so confident that I am finally a non-smoker again is because of his method. I had tried to quit many times in the past by sheer willpower, and at my best attempt I think I made it 1 day. Now that I am using his advice, I know this is the real deal. I am no longer a smoker who is simply denying himself what he craves. I now see that what I used to crave did absolutely nothing of use for me and cost me dearly in terms of my health, wallet, and peace of mind. And I think more importantly I realized that quitting smoking does not have to be the impossible gauntlet it is often depicted as being.

There have been a few mild cravings in the past week, but nothing I couldn't shake off almost immediately. I am honestly amazed at how easy this first week of being a non-smoker has been, and I don't mean that to be arrogant. What I mean is that becoming a non-smoker using Mr. Carr's advice has been unimaginably easier than my previous attempts at quitting via the willpower method. It's a vastly different approach when you finally get it in your head that smoking offers ZERO benefits and a million detriments.

I owe a lot to this subreddit. It's great to come and see the progress posts and discussions every day by people who are trying and succeeding at escaping the addiction. If you're here, you're already taking a step in the right direction. Arm yourself with the right knowledge and understand that you don't need a godly amount of willpower to stop smoking - you just need to be honest with yourself about what it's really doing for you.",crave

I’ve been vaping for a couple of weeks now and I am getting loads of mouth ulcers. I vape 70/30 vg pg, I vape 3-6mg nicotine, and I have never been a heavy cigarette smoker. 

Does anyone have any advice? It would be hugely appreciated as I don’t want to have to quit vaping. ",Canker sores

8zdjnb,"**Backstory:**

I've been seeing a therapist for years now to address what amounts to a very very shitty childhood. I am diagnosed as having PTSD due to the stuff I've lived through. While talking through my personal history with school and work I came to a point where I said ""I'm on thin ice, my manager keeps saying that I need to focus"". The therapist in turn stops the conversation and says that she has suspected that I may have ADD and that I should speak with a psychiatrist.

Fast forward some weeks and I meet with the psychiatrist. His call was to start treatment with 15mg Adderall.

Getting that diagnoses felt like a godsend. Everything just sharply came into focus. My underperformance in school while also being one of the smart kids, my constant messes (my home and work desks are battlefields), my start/stops with projects, my inability to sit and read without drifting off into adjacent thoughts, my anxiety, my sense that I am not living up to my potential, the fact that I am always late with deadlines....all of it just makes sense.

Before the diagnoses I was using a fuckton of coffee to get through the day as well as occasionally using modafinil and constantly using nicotine gum to keep focused.

**The Problems:**

So, I was ready to start taking the Adderall but I really needed my partner to be on board. I have a minor preexisting heart condition so I had that looked into, that doctor approved it and that doctor is in direct communication with the psychiatrist who is also in direct communication with my therapist. Solid village.

Now things are hinging on two points. The first is that I have addiction on both sides of my family but I have not expressed addiction in the sense of needing to attend a program. I have never lost a job because of substance abuse, I do not hide what I do. My partner is deeply afraid that I'm going to turn into an addicted user who will turn to god knows what to get my hands on drugs. Or shes convinced I would just turn to using adderall at all times. 

The second point is that my partner does not believe the diagnoses, or rather she thinks my therapist and psychiatrist are quacks or are too quick to diagnose because, PTSD and ADHD may share symptoms (and they are/can be comorbid). She thinks in the end its all just PTSD without seeing the bigger picture. 

There is also the issue that it's my doctors against hers. I trust my doctors but she is pitting what her own therapist is saying about my situation against my group of doctors.

So, I'm going to go for further analysis but I have a sense of what will be said.

I guess, I'm really fucking frustrated about this. To the savagelove fans out there, this is no DTMFA situation, this is my wife. Has anyone been through a similar situation?",addiction
8zdg7l,"May 25th, I decided to smoke a small, hand rolled cigarette.  I don't know why.  The feeling... my god, the feeling.  The sensation throughout my body was divine.  Tingly, heavenly...  welcoming.  Like the hug of an old friend. May 26th, I smoked another.  I vowed to only dabble...  to smoke one on occasion so that I always enjoyed this feeling, this high, of the smoke.

13 days (maybe 4-6 hand rollies)  later, I bought a pack of nicotine gum in hopes of achieving that same glorious feeling once in awhile at work but without the nasty side effects of smoking...  the smell, the sore throat, the health impact.  The gum was a little tingly but overall underwhelming.  

Over the next few weekends when I was drunk I'd smoked a few hand rolled cigarettes until I became too drunk to roll.  Same thing on 6-9.  So when 6-16 rolled around and the loose tobacco was out, I begged my husband to pick up a pack Marlboro lights ""to cut them open and use the tobacco for rollies"" .. Instead, I just smoked them intermittently (on evenings when I drank) over the next few weeks between hand rollies.  

When I smoked that pack, I bought another.  That night my husband casually mentioned when the Marlboros were gone, we shouldn't buy more because we didn't want to keep smoking.  Although it was too late, I agreed.  I replaced that old pack with the new one, determined not to buy anymore after that.  After all, it's not like I was a smoker again.

On 6-8, I bought a disposable e-cig.  I spent the entire week of 6-8 vaping at work.  At my desk.  In the bathroom.  After the kids go to bed.  Late at night in the shower.  I ended up buying 2 packs of refills and 3 more starter kits for a total of 8 cartridges in a weeks time.

Worst part?  I no longer get the feeling.  I don't get the high.  Now I'm just dependent on it.  Worst of all, I can feel myself being short tempered with my kids.  With my husband.  With people around me.  I'm irritable and I know what's causing it:  nicotine.  I've gone from a non smoker to a nicotine fiend in 7 weeks.  

ITS NOT EVEN NOTICEABLY ENJOYABLE ANYMORE.  I don't get the tingly, heavenly sensation pulsing like happy lightening through my body when I take a hit.  Not when I light up, not when I puff on the vape, not when I chew the gum.  The nicotine doesn't give me the high anymore, it only (barely and temporarily) satiates the irritability.  The solution to the problem is also the cause.

A problem I didn't have 8 weeks ago.  Damn you nicotine, you beautiful yet lethal mistress.  Tease.  And now after 7 years of being a non smoker, I have to quit again :(  Here's to day 1!

I am having a drink and was discussing  business with my partner, it's been awhile this routine. As we often did this while smoking and smoking up. 

Since I've quit smoking now we stopped this for awhile, things were a bit bitter but we've been in business together for far too long and we got each other through and through. 

I'm not sure if I can smoke up though as I tend to have alot of cigarettes after, if I do smoke up it has to be without the nicotine, I guess? Anyone done this? any suggestions will help. I'm fine giving it up as well. 

I've been having a drink in the evenings well we all need something to losen our inhibitions. But Even a drink gives me a craving especially following the older routine. I have to change it up. If I'm by myself I don't feel like smoking only when I'm around other smokers.

I believe/think I have an addictive nature, nicotine has to be out of it. Drinks is fine as I don't have  too much, and I Know myself on it. The thing with pot is after awhile I get paranoid and don't know what is real and what's imagined. Guess even drinking too much will/can do that if it does not knock me out first :D but the past I drank too much was when I was in my teens. 

Anyways I guess this post helped me think it through I'm feeling better now... About not smoking. Also, I still can use suggestions about the weed. Anyone who quit smoking continue on this with vape? I've never done it clean so it may blow my brains out : D",craving

Can this be explained on a neurological level? What makes an individual more or less susceptible to addiction? And I guess to follow up that question; can all personality traits be broken down to such a level as well? Thanks. ",addiction

I weigh 96kg and I'm 6""1. I was 130kg at my biggest a few years back and I just know that despite keeping that weight off, I need more. It has to be constant - and a complete change in mindset and genuine understanding - longterm. If anyone has any good books they recommend I'd be grateful. I quit smoking 8 years ago using a couple of books debunking the nicotine trap and it worked immediately, not smoked since. Firmly believe that knowledge is power, etc.

8zaeut,"So this is quite a long read, sorry! I wrote this the other day, and wanted to share it.

The date was April 20th – a notorious day around the world for hippies, stoners and the average Joe who enjoys the occasional smoke. I believe any other avid weed smoker would agree with me when I say that 4/20 feels like a stoners Christmas. What better excuse is there to hang out with the friends you love most, get high and share great experiences with? It’s fucking 4/20, man! 

Let’s begin with the night before – the eve of the day my friends and I had been excited for and discussing for months. We trekked to the usual man who would sell us weed regularly, about an hour journey there and back – no problem. He is a funny character, but always has quality weed and is always willing to sell. We’re definitely happy with the non-spoken agreement we have with this man. So, we buy an ounce of what was believed to be amnesia – a very common strain around London. For good reason, however, it’s always a nice smoke. The effects definitely give its name justice. Our weed is retrieved, and we head back home. The process of what we call ‘marijuana the split’ was performed, in reference to Earl Sweatshirt’s ‘Knight’. We split our weed four ways – seven grams of grass each. They were like our Christmas presents. We could open them early, but we wouldn’t have as many for the next day which is the day that really counts. I smoke as little as possible before heading to bed, and pre-roll all my weed. I find rolling outside to be such a pain; wind speeds can be unpredictable. You have a lot more control inside when rolling up a joint. I recall being able to make nine king-L joints, and two standard blunts – not too shabby for a quarter ounce.

I wake up, 10am. It feels like Christmas, but even better! Naturally the first thing you have to do on 4/20 is get one of your friends over to your place and spark up a blunt. We used a blueberry hemp wrap, and they have a very natural feeling to them. It’s the same sensation of smoking a blunt minus the lightheaded nicotine rush you get. Good flavour, too. My 4/20 squad gathers shortly after the blunt, and we begin our trek to Hyde Park. I’ve been there several times before on 4/20. Each time there has been a peaceful and accepting atmosphere. However a lot of people do just go there to smoke weed. It’s important to remember you’re trying to make a difference – a difference in making cannabis legal. Why? Less dealers on the street, legal use of it for medication, millions to be made on tax and less time wasted by police dealing with stoners – just to name a few reasons. With the amount of police and online publication this event gets, it’s important to spread a message of peace and positivity of not just the medicinal and recreational use of weed, but also a face behind the smoke. 

My expectations of the event this year were very different than what actually happened. The weed we bought was quality, and we ended up just smoking, eating, listening to music and drifting in and out of consciousness in the scorching sun for a good four hours. It’s always a magical moment when it hits 4:20pm at the park. It’s almost obligatory that you spark a joint or blunt for yourself. Why not two? We decided a few days prior to attempt to get hold of some acid for after this smoky event. I called the iconic man, who we called Sid. In reality, we had and still have no idea of his real name; he sells acid, so obviously we had to call him Sid. Another drug dealer we knew who was quite the character. We always joked about him being an evil genius, who wore a lab coat round the house making unfathomable amounts of acid in his labs – he seemed like the type. I gave him a call around five, and he said he was at the park also – perfect! We gathered, and waddled over to meet him and one of his boys, as he guided us over to his spot with his other boys and his bag, which I can only assume was full of drugs. He explained to us he had no tabs unfortunately, but he did have liquid pre-dropped on sugar cubes. Of course I was intrigued – advertised at 260 micrograms per cube, who would be complaining? So we bought eight, thanked the man, and went on our merry way home to trip balls. 

I distinctly remember what felt like a very long journey home. One long tube ride, and a bus in the afternoon sun is never pleasant. It gets sticky very quickly. We soon arrive back at our halls, and stumble back upstairs where we take our acid. I drop three cubes, friend A also drops three and friend B drops two. In retrospect, this idea was pretty stupid – however, we are all fools when it comes to acid; all seeking the psychedelic break through to ‘heal us’. How silly we were. In my view, acid doesn’t hold any answers but acts somewhat as a catalyst into our inner psyche to bring up subconscious desires and thoughts. It really is fascinating to be confronted with your true self and, depending on your point of view, that can be either beautiful or terrifying. Only after about twenty minutes of dropping the acid, I’m starting to feel it – pretty strong too. However, I doubt the sugar cubes were 260 micrograms, but were definitely very strong nonetheless. As soon as it kicked in, things began to slowly go south.

The thing I have found with acid is I can’t stay in the same location for a long time, otherwise I will slowly but surely lose my sanity. From what I’ve heard, it’s a similar case for a lot of other fellow psychonauts. As a result of this, my friends and I decided to sit out on top of a communal area within our student halls. To paint a picture, it was surrounded by buildings which students all lived in with hundreds of windows with a perfect vantage point to the sofas we were sat on, which was located about a story or two high – whereas the other buildings ranged from eleven to sixteen stories. I distinctly remember the buildings we were surrounded by collapsing and falling into themselves, as if they had just undergone a demolition process. It was at this point strange vibes began to creep in, as I realised far too much acid had been consumed. Because of the buildings collapsing, I could only see blue sky beyond this building we were on. It felt as if we were on the only structure still stable on this planet. I remember thinking ‘shit, how are we going to get back? The stairs down to the ground with lead to the abyss, and our building has gone’. Silly, psychedelic overthinking is always stupid when you look back at it.

By some miracle, we managed to get back to the room, which I have absolutely no recollection of, of course. We proceeded to sit in pure psychedelia, as the visuals and other sensory deception took over – what I was absorbing through my senses was not what was really happening. I managed to somehow make it onto an airbed that was in the room, and lied down as the body high was simply far too much for me to sit up right. Because of this experience, the airbed still sends me bad vibrations every time I see it – as if it knows and has seen too much. As I laid on the airbed, my acid came on so strong to the point I didn’t even know it was possible it could be that strong. I was fully immersed in visuals – I could barely see my hand when I held it in front of my face. Ego death is a term that gets thrown around a lot regarding psychedelics, and oh boy did I go through one. I laid on that cursed bed, having forgotten my name, forgotten my friends names, forgotten who I was as a person and even forgot I was on acid. I was fully convinced this was my life for the rest of eternity. I couldn’t do anything to save myself from the hole I dug myself a few hours prior, which I only just fell deep into.

During this time, my visuals were very dark – physically and metaphorically. I remember it looking like a dark, grim and abandoned abyss – no love, no people and no hope. I was left in complete despair. Then, something magical happened. I heard a voice. But where was it coming from? Who was it? At the time writing this, I know it was friend A, who was also submerged in dark psychedelia. However, at the time these events took place, I had no option but to trust the voice. To quote myself ‘I don’t know who you are, but I trust you’. We eventually somehow found each other in this dark abyss in physical form. We held each other in our arms – crying our eyes out believing we were going to escape this dark void. Thinking about that experience still gives me a weird feeling in my throat and makes me shiver ever so slightly. However, our trust of each other’s voice prevailed. Shortly after, I began to remember social constructs and simple things such as people’s names and my own personal identity. It was beautiful really. Friend A and I have experienced a lot together, and we’re those two friends who you always see together somehow – never without the other, like Fred and George Weasley. To this day it still saddens me we had to go through such a dark and traumatic experience just to understand the true power of acid. We’re good people – we didn’t deserve that much of a dark experience. Nonetheless, we have both learned a lot from it and healed significantly from the trip. It helped us get a lot closer; not that we weren’t close friends already. We are brothers. I’ve only known the man for ten or so months – yet I still indescribably love him. 

So what did I learn from this experience? I definitely learnt that I shouldn’t fuck about with acid! British culture around drugs is extremely fiendish – with people I’ve seen as young as fifteen taking unfathomable amounts of class A’s such as MDMA. It’s become a competitive culture – unspoken, but always lingering at a social gathering or a night out. ‘I can do more drugs than you’. It’s fucking stupid that people treat harming the body with neurotoxic chemicals like MDMA as if it were a sport. I guess that aspect of British drug culture engulfed me that night. ‘Of course, I can handle (supposedly) 780 micrograms of acid’. No chance, son. The friends I tripped with that night I will never forget. I have, as I’m sure they do too, so much love to give. It’s extremely wholesome knowing they exist and I can be involved with them. I’ve said it once, and I’ll say it again to end on an upbeat note – I love them so much.", sensory deception

8z8lyu,"Compared to yesterday, today was a tough day again.

I had work topday and when I woke up I felt like something was trying to leave my body and idk what it could be whether it was nerves or withdrawal but it seemed too early to decide what it was.

I visited my parents today for the first time with both of them in the room and it felt awkward. I told them I went out yesterday with my gf and how I held a big ass thing of water so not even alcohol would tempt me. They were like ""that's good"" which I don't think got through to them. My gf said she would talk to my mom for me a little bit because she has seen me everyday and its been an emotional roller coaster for us both since she's known I've been smoking since I was 16 years old but she told me on the way home that she didn't speak to her and that I should take it day at a time. I agree with her but for some reason that made me think of the moments when I would be smoking. Like right now, I'm back at my apartment watching TV and typing this when I'm usually smoking a blunt or a bowl right now and IT'S DIFFICULT AF. I don't wanna call it a quits but by God this shit is hard af. Luckily in the next two days I'm visiting some friends in the city who are not huge into smoking and have been helping me cope with my addiction. I thought about juuling or doing disposable vapes but the whole feeling of nicotine kinda grosses me out but when I was 15 I smoked disposables and felt fine... I'm kinda contradicting myself I feel like so IDK.

I will say this, my sleep has been so much better and I had my first dream in months and it felt extremely real and I gotta say I missed that feeling.

8z8ewj,"Okay here is my experience with nutmeg

Keep in mind the nutmeg was old and it was ground nutmeg so it wasn't fresh in the first place

So right now I'm in Utah and weed is illegal and my dad over here recently got off of drugs (not like he had that much of a choice since weeds illegal) but we both moved from Washington and he's pretty strict so I decided to try to trip on nutmeg because I saw on orange is the new black the crazy bitches were doing it and I found out you really could get high off of nutmeg so I gave it a try despite the countless reports not to so here is my trip

10:00pm took 3 tablespoons of ground nutmeg

10:05pm a slight funny feeling may just be because I was scared at first

10:30pm funny feeling begins to grow but nothing too weird

11:30pm slight stoned feeling no euphoria but stomach hurt a bit and nausea 

12:30am medium stoned as if I smoked half a bull out of a pipe but it did feel good

2:30am started to feel euphoria but a different kind of euphoria almost a sexual euphoria if that makes sense

3:30am the effects are wearing off it wasn't even that big of a trip in the first place so it wasn't worth it

4:00am I finally go to sleep realizing it's not going to make me trip like a weed/lsd feeling I heard about online

10:00am I wake up feeling a slight nicotine buzz as if I smoked a cigarette 5 minutes ago

Over summary: If your going to try it there are Pros and Cons, Pros: good if it's all you have, creates a buzz effect that you will still seem normal to others but you feel different yourself Cons: it's not like any other drug if your looking for a replacement, it was quite addicting I did it for 5 nights until I ran out, nausea and headaches and stomach aches

So if you read this far before you comment something ignorant like ""fuck nutmeg"" it was actually good it wasn't a hallucination trip but it does make you realize things like a self realization definitely going to try whole nutmeg once but would not recommend trying ground nutmeg more than once and if you do try it three tablespoons is enough I used a regular spoon from my plastic silverware kit

I'm currently dosing on 275 mg benadryl will create a follow up wish me luck",stomach hurt

So, I consider myself as a weekend/occasional smoker. It’s a social thing I do and I almost never smoke alone. I don’t have a nicotine addiction imo (i can stay without it easily as long as i want) but recently I got sick of the bad smelling smoke and that sore throat you get after smoking too many cigarettes the night before.

I absolutely love it! You get that small nicotine hit youre looking for with regular tobacco, it tastes better, bigger clouds (human fogmachine fuck yeah!), you can do tricks with it, easy to share - all that good stuff! 

TLDR:

Now, sounds too good to be true.. So my question is: HOW BAD IS VAPING FOR YOU?

I mean like, how bad are the ingredient themself for you?

Obviously nicotine is the worst am i wrong?

But for example I just like the act of vaping and making tricks etc. so i have no problem lowering my nicotine dose on the mix.

How about the other stuff? The flavouring and the base? What about the fact that youre inhailing so much moisture?

8z0w1l,"Provocative topic, I'm aware.

I'm not BuzzFeed. I'm not going to click bait you to  learning a simple trick to gaining more belly fat. In fact I'm not selling you one simple anything. I'm offering you hope.

**Context**

I started smoking weed about 17 years ago. Since I was the poorest of our stoner group, I was usually smoking someone else's weed. Everyone else in my group smoked tobacco, so we smoked weed with tobacco. 5 years later I broke and bought my first pack of cigarettes. I've been trying to quit ever since.

During my smoking/quitting career I've noticed that there are two types of smokers who quit; those that relapse and those who don't. People tend to think this has everything to do with strength of character, but I've become convinced this isn't the case. I believe that it has something to do with how your body responds to drugs, nicotine in this case.

When you make the grand declaration of quitting, you gain a lot of approval and patting of the back from your peers, apparently this is sufficient drug replacement therapy for those that don't relapse. I relapsed, over a dozen times. I can do the ""3 days"" standing on my head. Usually time from quitting to relapse for me was a few months. I've concluded that this was because my body is exceptionally good at learning this sort of bad habits.

**The way**

There wasn't a quitting method in the world that worked for me, and the fact that my mother has been addicted to pills and alcohol longer than I've lived, didn't fill me with confidence. There had to be a way. As a sort of desperate measure, I went back to my old pattern of limiting my smoking to with-weed-only. This wasn't easy, and during my 2 years of doing this I did cave and buy a pack every now and then. Overall however, I did manage to cut my nicotine intake from a pack a day to a couple of cigarettes a day, during the 2 years. When I got an opportunity of landing the job of my dreams, I got the motivation to stop smoking altogether. This is not to say I stopped taking nicotine, I just changed the method of delivery yet again, this time from with-weed-only to nicotine-gum-only. I kept taking less and less nicotine, until I was down to 1mg/day. After this I stopped taking nicotine and started vaporizing weed. This was about two months ago. At first I always felt angry and betrayed after vaporizing, presumably because I was still subconsciously  expecting to get that sickly bliss that nicotine used to give me. Today I'm losing interest to weed because I'm no longer driven to smoking like I used to be.

I didn't pull this ""way"" out of my ass. In fact it's mostly based on what I've learned from psychology and of neuroplasticity. The addiction had become part of my personality, and to get rid of it I had to get rid of part of myself. Now if changing your personality was as simple as changing your mind, how would you know who you are? Anyone could be anyone at any given time. One moment you could be Charlie Manson and the next you could be Mahatma Fucking Gandhi. In other words, personality doesn't change overnight, it changes over years.

**Wrap it up asshole**

I'm writing this post because I've noticed that many people come here seeking help. I hope that this post can at least give hope to someone who's feeling stuck.

Don't give up. Never give up.

For the first week it was pretty clear when I was thirsty and when I wanted to smoke. Now I seriously cannot tell. For example I was feeling queasy for the past hour or so and I thought I had an intense nicotine craving. But then I drank a whole bottle of water and it was instantly gone. This isn't the first time either. Yesterday the same happened when I couldn't tell the difference between hungry and nicotine craving. other instances include feeling dirty (I live on a tropical island, feel queasy if I dont take a shower every 12~14 hours), horny or tired.

Please help me speed this process along and help me understand the ground work so i avoid hurting my wife when my intent is to help.

I have a Mod and tank i have set aside and cleared for testing fluids for mixing vape fluid. it is a Sigelei 150 Box mod, Wattage range 10-150, 2 18650 Batteries and Cleito XO 3 Mil tank. i intend to use this to make fluid for my wife, which the focus will be pain management and to combat her Nausea caused by pain. from what i have read so far my focus should be CBD, NOT THC. 

Terms: Oils, eliquids, Juice. It seems there is no clear definition between them for CBD fluid/oil. I don't want to be giving my wife Pneumonia on top of everything, so if we can clear that one up it would help immensely. Lastly, Flavoring and mixing, in a perfect world i would be able to get food grade VG/PG with a CBD base like Nicotine, but i don't see that readily available. So how does CBD fluid stand up tp mixing? can i use the same methods as i do for mixing normal Nicotine e-Juice while being mindful of the temperature? or is this all wishful?", Nausea

I would actually give serious amounts of money for a reasonable medical/physiological explanation for this. I have googled the shit out of this and come up with nothing. I have asked doctors but gotten ""eh, it's for the best, whatever.""

I'm not worried about it medically, I am just outrageously fucking curious re. what happened ?

1. **TLDR;** The title: Light smoker for \~8 years; then, after 1 weekend of binge smoking, cigarettes still make me super sick, even 3 years later. WHY? What happened?
2. **Me:** Female, \~30 y/o, low-normal weight, white, no outstanding health stuff.
3. **The story:**

I smoked about 4 (""light"") cigarettes per day from ages 19-27. (I know, bad. I'm not looking to start again.)

Then I spent a weekend with a new boyfriend who was a chain smoker, and I ended up chain smoking with him for those 2.5 days. I also had a cold that weekend.

Since that weekend, cigarettes made me feel ill for hours afterwards (throat was the worst; it would feel constricted and raw and taste bizarre, but my chest would also hurt and I would feel generally nauseous). Often I would still feel sick even the next day.

I admit **it took me at least a year and a half** to finally concede defeat and give them up entirely; I kept assuming it was temporary/stress/pollution. It's not that I even liked the nicotine or anything, I just loved the taste and the rhythm it gave to my days/work/social life. **Even one cigarette could make me ill the whole weekend whereas I'd never had any reaction to them before**.

I know it's still a thing; it's actually at the point now where **second-hand smoke starts to make me feel ill as well**, which sucks because I live in France now, hah.

Any mood altering substances i ingest i have a hard time quitting and cigarettes are one of them, i think the reason i struggle with cigs is that i started to smoke quite early (age 13) so they have been a part of my teenage years thus all the good memories are usually attached to smoking, if anyone know a god way to kick the addiction to cigarettes themself ( not nicotine ) it would be greatly apreaciated 

and sorry for any bad english spelling as i am wrighting this quite drunk",addiction

I've tried to update the firmware but I can hear my pc making the sound that it's being unplugged and plugged in again and again and again so I can't finish it. Will try another PC.

Batteries fully charged... seems to be a problem lots of people are having with it.

I've been strictly charging it by USB because the stupid thing is really weird about the battery positioning and it's a PITA taking them out

EDIT: 
Alright so the firmware update worked this morning but now when I plug it in, it says it's installing drivers. It recognizes it. About 5 seconds after I click ""Start"" to update the firmware, I can hear the usb disconnected device sound and then it says fail to find device.

whenever I'm going to a bar, a party or any kind of event that does not incolve a very specific activity ( like a movie, a restaurant...) besides drinking / talking, I'm just... Not ""there"" and all I want to do is going home. All my friends are smoking and even if I an easily control my cravings while drinking / partying, I just feel like something is missing, like I'm not in tune with the others, so I'm not enjoying myself at all and just leave. I started smoking around 17yo and smoked for 15 years, so all my ""social adult life"" involved smoking and I now have to figure out how to deal with these situations without cigarettes.

This makes me sad because I just miss who I was before I quit, plus seing people is what is helping me with the sadness / emotonial rollercoaster of quitting.

I sometimes think about going back to smoking just for that, even if I really don't want to smoke again? I know it doesn't make sense, just wanted to share my feelings with people who might be experiencing the same!

At first when arena was still pretty empty, every time they spot someone smoking, they came to person and ask them to put it out, and then walk away. Obviously person would start smoking again, just a bit more discreet. But once the main show started, all the rules were out of the window, people could smoke freely, cuz there no way security would get to them. 

IMO people who smoke cigarettes indoors should be kicked out, on first offense. There are alternatives that you can use to get your nicotine craving, and they arent that expensive, and dont inconvenience people around you.

So I used to vape almost 24/7, 3mg, while on anti-depressants and everything was chill. 

Awhile ago I went of my happy medicine for a week or so, and continued vaping while at it. Recently I went back on them and now whenever I vape I get headaches. I was wondering if any of y'all had any advice on what I should do? I was on a higher dose when I was vaping like crazy so it's not that I can't have nicotine on them, I'm just, concerned and was wondering if anyone has experienced this before.

A good example of this would be when one has a tragic event or a painful memory in their lives.

8zyb3t,"I just need to get this out. It's been 17 days since I last talked to my ex. He's like an addiction to me. Quitting mxe was easy peasy compared to quitting this guy. He's physically beat me about 6 times and emotionally messed with me. He's threatened my life dozens of times and even threatened to hurt my family. Omg why do I STILL miss him???? Anyway, he always told me i should get off my prozac (I've been on meds since I was 12, bipolar, anxiety, depression, I'm kind of a handful) so I slowly started to ween off it.
That was a year ago and since then I've gained 20 pounds, started cutting myself again, lost interest in everything I used to love, stopped talking to my family or checking in, the list goes on.

We then broke up and I changed my number and deleted his so I wouldn't be tempted to call him.
 My self esteem was at an all time low. I felt like I hit rock bottom. I woke up, chugged gin, played video games and drank till I passed out.
I finally got myself to the doctor last week and he had me go back to my normal dose of 60 instead of the 20 I was taking. I already feel so much better. It seems so obvious now but it was hard to see in the middle of the depression.
I realize that not talking to my ex for 17 days and hearing his toxic crap, constantly putting me down, that's helping too. Seriously, I couldn't do anything right with this guy and it broke my heart to disappoint him. I'd spill coffee and he would yell at me for an hour about what a ""fat townie loser"" I was. And I really thought I deserved it when he hit me. I wasn't disciplined much as a kid so I thought he was good for me. Sort of putting me in my place. God why do I STILL miss him??
Anyway, moral of the story, listen to your doctor, not your asshole boyfriend. I know it seems like ""duhhh"" but when you're hooked on a dude and you grew up believing in ""love conquers all"" and ""someday my prince will come"" and you grow up watching your mom getting beaten it's a hard thing to avoid.

He's physically beat me about 6 times and emotionally messed with me. He's threatened my life dozens of times and even threatened to hurt my family. Omg why do I STILL miss him???? Anyway, he always told me i should get off my prozac (I've been on meds since I was 12, bipolar, anxiety, depression, I'm kind of a handful) so I slowly started to ween off it.
That was a year ago and since then I've gained 20 pounds, started cutting myself again, lost interest in everything I used to love, stopped talking to my family or checking in, the list goes on.

We then broke up and I changed my number and deleted his so I wouldn't be tempted to call him.
 My self esteem was at an all time low. I felt like I hit rock bottom. I woke up, chugged gin, played video games and drank till I passed out.
I finally got myself to the doctor last week and he had me go back to my normal dose of 60 instead of the 20 I was taking. I already feel so much better. It seems so obvious now but it was hard to see in the middle of the depression.
I realize that not talking to my ex for 17 days and hearing his toxic crap, constantly putting me down, that's helping too. Seriously, I couldn't do anything right with this guy and it broke my heart to disappoint him. I'd spill coffee and he would yell at me for an hour about what a ""fat townie loser"" I was. And I really thought I deserved it when he hit me. I wasn't disciplined much as a kid so I thought he was good for me. Sort of putting me in my place. God why do I STILL miss him??
Anyway, moral of the story, listen to your doctor, not your asshole boyfriend. I know it seems like ""duhhh"" but when you're hooked on a dude and you grew up believing in ""love conquers all"" and ""someday my prince will come"" and you grow up watching your mom getting beaten it's a hard thing to avoid.

8zxmjm,"Hi everyone, I’m halfway through my second pack of yaz and I can’t help but noticed the drastic change in my sex drive. I’m 23, and I literally have not felt horny or any sexual feelings at all since I was like 17, I thought Prozac had permanently killed my libido completely. And I always wished I’d feel horny again. Well now I’m really greatful I can again but it’s kind of starting to get in the way:.. I’m constantly thinking about sex and fantasizing and wanting to masturbate, and it only seems to be increasing. Is this normal? Will it chill out or turn down a bit to a more normal libido once I’m through my 3rd pack? Sorry this is a weird post but I’m starting to wonder if I will have to change pills because it’s starting to be too much. ",killed my libido

8zt662,"Hi everyone. I started Prozac about a month and a bit ago. My doctor increased my dose right before I went back to work a week ago (was on medical leave for a few weeks). 

I worked one shift last week and during the shift I assisted some people to get a large person off the floor. No big deal. The shift was average and I went home happy. Then this past weekend was my boyfriends brothers wedding! Aside from a painful headache, it was a good day. I was feeling anxious, but it was so nice to be a part of. 
So 3 days after my shift, 1 day after the wedding, I get this really intense pain in my side. Can’t get comfortable at all in bed trying to sleep. Eventually I did sleep, but I woke up an hour later in terrible pain. I looked up muscle groups to try to visualize where it was coming from and suddenly I went into a full on panic attack. I woke up my boyfriend and we drove to the ER. When I was finally seen the doctor said I strained a muscle, gave me meds, and sent me on my way. We were there from 3am-7am. 

I was supposed to work that day. I called my manager and told her I wouldn’t be in, and that I thought I hurt myself at work because of the guy who fell. I hadn’t even slept at that point. Now its been a few days and the more I think of it, the less I believe it was work that caused the strain. Why didn’t I have ANY symptoms until 3 days later? They sent me 20 pages of forms for hurt at work injuries and the “what happened” sections are just stressing me out because I feel like I shouldn’t bother filling them out because I genuinely have no clue whether it WAS a work injury. I just feel guilty and overwhelmed. 

I really just want to go back to work. We’re understaffed as it is and I don’t want to cause any more issues. I have an appointment with my family doctor on Thursday and a chiropractor tomorrow. Hoping someone can help me figure out this mess. ",painful headache

""Good"" times I just have a ""meh, could be worse"" but I only cry about how I look is during bad times. It didn't really start getting terrible until this year (2017/2018). I was bulimic/anorexic a while back but never did I get so pissed at myself for being so fat and ugly I cried after I ate. I can't explain how I hate myself more now that I'm ""recovered"" - I'm not even going through episodes of purging and restricting: sure I think about it, sure I want to do it but there's just something else that's giving me such anxiety to the point where I fucking hate myself when I didn't back then. 


Told and ex doctor about this - I was prescribed Prozac : mainly for the bulimia. That didn't do anything  but  numb me out and make me feel unmotivated. I had a ""what the fuck is the point"" attitude. 
People in my family have also noticed the agitation and hypomanic symptoms in me (but no episodes)



Then out of nowhere BOOM it gets bad- I restrict and purge again, I feel worthless, i feel like I'll amount to nothing (where I'm at now, I feel too stupid for university, I feel like I'm not good enough for university and of course I'm at the point where I just straight up hate myself. I look in the mirror and want to die)


I've always always always had a low self esteem but I don't know if the bulimia increases the ""depression"" or if out of nowhere my 'bipolar' just says ""HERE WE GO DEPRESSION IN MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE""
It slowly builds up then I get mad at my body and that's when the bulimia comes idk. It feels like it hits me out of nowhere like a ton of bricks but it's not like I don't notice it nagging at me.



I never had any episodes but bipolar runs in my family (brother has it, aunt has it, grandma has it and my other grandma has bipolar and schizophrenia. I'm also 20 and I heard your first episode shows up then??)

I always thought this was normal since I have anxiety disorder and that causes sleepiness, but we checked twice for anemia and thyroid problems just in case and those came up clean.

I had a sleep study and it turned out clean for sleep disorders, though they confirmed I have a low sleep latency and sleep way too much (got a full night and 5/5 naps). They want to bounce me back to the anxiety folks, but I'm not sure this time. My psych doctors and I worked to change my meds before this sleep study to ones that shouldn't make me drowsy and that did nothing at all to help after 3 different switches. I'm still on one where drowsiness is a factor, but the amount I sleep is pretty wild even for the side effects of Prozac. I'm at my wits end.

This weekend, I slept 10+ hours overnight Friday to Saturday. Woke up at 11pm and then fell back asleep at 3pm for what was supposed to be a 1 hour nap. Woke up again at 6:30PM and felt drowsy again by eight, but forced myself to keep awake until midnight to be awake more than 6 hours that day. Then today, woke up at 9:30AM (so 9 hours) and had three cups of caffeinated tea to skip a nap. I've still almost fallen asleep or wanted to sleep most of the day. No matter how much sleep I get, this always happens. I'm rarely ever awake unless heavily caffeinated. And even then I can nap at any moment. I've almost fallen asleep standing up at work twice, and sitting down so many times I've lost count.

I have another physical this week just to triple check iron and thyroid, but knowing my past history they're going to come out clean and probably bounce me back to psych. I have depression and anxiety, but they've been super well managed for the last two months (and most of this 8 year period), so the tiredness is the only symptom that really remains. Is there any other avenues I should look down, or should I accept blaming it on my psych disorders, even though my psych doctors think it's not the case. I should also note, I was born with anxiety disorder and on the same anxiety meds since middle school and I didn't have this sleep problem until high school. 

TLDR: Excessive sleeping problems are being blamed on my psych issues, but psych doctors disagree. Is there anything else it could be? ",drowsiness

The lexapro combined with that good old freshman 15 has caused me to gain 30 pounds since starting starting the medication in August of last year. I switched to prozac in January and found that that helped stop my weight gain.. The problem is, I had to switch back to lexapro because the prozac wasn’t helping my anxiety.

I have since gained five pounds despite eating healthy and running each night without fail. I know that it is because of the prozac because when I was 17 (i’m now 19) I went on a weight loss journey and did everything that I am doing now and managed to lose 20 pounds in 3 months. 

I am weaning myself off of my anxiety because of this weight gain and the fact that I feel I no longer need the medicine, but as you may know it takes a while to wean yourself off of medicine.

Mental conditions: Panic attack disorder and GAD

History with Klonopin: 

* 2010 to 2012 - 2 mg per day
* 2012 to 2014 - Prozac, phased out Klonopin entirely
* 2014 to 2015 - Relapsed into panic attack disorder. Started taking Klonopin as needed.
* 2016 to May 2017 - Slowly started depending on it more, multiple times a week. Stopped taking Prozac since it wasn't working.
* May 2017 to September 2017 - increased to 1 mg per day.
* October 2017 to November 2017 - Peaked at 1.25 mg per day.
* December 2017 to April 2018 - Tapered to .50 mg


Why I Decided to Taper: The Klonopin simply wasn't properly treating my anxiety, it was worsening it. It just wasn't working. If it were, I wouldn't be feeling SO anxious all the time. Also, it's just not sustainable. The body builds tolerance to it.

How I Tapered: I started facing my fears more and slowly tapered down. In a month I went from 1 mg - 1.50 mg per day to .75 mg. It then took me two months to get to .50 mg. That's when it got very difficult and I held at .50 mg for several months. 

Final Push: Last month I went from .50 mg to .25 mg in a week. The following week I took .25 mg every other day. The third week I stopped taking it. I've been without Klonopin for ten days and I feel pretty good.

Withdrawal Process: In the last push I experienced some withdrawal in the form of higher anxiety, fuzzy brain/inability to concentrate, pain in the body, and blurry vision, and agitation. Probably a lot of other symptoms as well but they feel relatively mild. The days after my last dose were the hardest, especially the first three. After that it only gets better each day. The fuzzy brain feeling went away two days ago. Now I mainly have body pain sometimes during the day and a bit of nausea. Very manageable.

What Triggered the Sudden Decrease?: My doctor prescribed me CBD. It does wonders and treats my anxiety better than the Klonopin with little to no side effects. It's also treating my withdrawal symptoms. Doesn't eliminate them, but makes them a lot more manageable.

Forms of Therapy: I don't just take CBD. Throughout the years I've learned to meditate, do breathing exercises, exercise, changed my lifestyle and diet, foster healthy relationships, go to therapy, practice self-care, etc. I basically worked at trying to live healthier.

I hope this information is useful to others. If you have questions, please let me know. I wish you all good luck.",panic attack

Final Push: Last month I went from .50 mg to .25 mg in a week. The following week I took .25 mg every other day. The third week I stopped taking it. I've been without Klonopin for ten days and I feel pretty good.

Withdrawal Process: In the last push I experienced some withdrawal in the form of higher anxiety, fuzzy brain/inability to concentrate, pain in the body, and blurry vision, and agitation. Probably a lot of other symptoms as well but they feel relatively mild. The days after my last dose were the hardest, especially the first three. After that it only gets better each day. The fuzzy brain feeling went away two days ago. Now I mainly have body pain sometimes during the day and a bit of nausea. Very manageable.

What Triggered the Sudden Decrease?: My doctor prescribed me CBD. It does wonders and treats my anxiety better than the Klonopin with little to no side effects. It's also treating my withdrawal symptoms. Doesn't eliminate them, but makes them a lot more manageable.

Forms of Therapy: I don't just take CBD. Throughout the years I've learned to meditate, do breathing exercises, exercise, changed my lifestyle and diet, foster healthy relationships, go to therapy, practice self-care, etc. I basically worked at trying to live healthier.

Mental conditions: Panic attack disorder and GAD

History with Klonopin: 

* 2010 to 2012 - 2 mg per day
* 2012 to 2014 - Prozac, phased out Klonopin entirely
* 2014 to 2015 - Relapsed into panic attack disorder. Started taking Klonopin as needed.
* 2016 to May 2017 - Slowly started depending on it more, multiple times a week. Stopped taking Prozac since it wasn't working.
* May 2017 to September 2017 - increased to 1 mg per day.
* October 2017 to November 2017 - Peaked at 1.25 mg per day.
* December 2017 to April 2018 - Tapered to .50 mg

I really disliked my old doctor, he was not very personable and didn't seem like he even knew who I was. I think that's what kept me away so long. My boyfriend (who's also bipolar/has PTSD)convinced me that it would be a good idea to try again even though I've been worried to the point of vomiting about having to go back..

Roughly 4 weeks ago I began to feel tightness in my chest with pain radiating into my left arm. I went to the ER and they checked my blood work and determined that I was not having an heart attack. However they did refer me to a cardiologist. One week ago following a nuclear stress test and echo cardiogram I had angioplasty performed and it was discovered I had an 80% block in my left anterior descending artery. A stent was inserted and I went home the same day. That day I was put on all the medications listed above (except the bupropion, famotidine and sucralfate).

Immediately after the insertion of the stent I felt the chest tightness alleviate. However, within a few days I noticed some odd sensations in my chest. At first I thought I was feeling the stent and just needed to adapt to it. I had a pain in roughly the same area as before, the left side of my chest and and just a bit up into the left side of my neck, but this time it was more of a burning sensation than a tightness. I noticed that it tended to flare up after eating and partially subside later on. After having particularly heavy, spicy/greasy meal the other night (stupid, I know) it immediately got very bad and didn't subside even after 5 hours. I sucked it up and went to the ER again. My concern was that restenosis was happening and I had a clot or that my one shitty meal somehow blocked my widow maker again and I was about to die. I admit I was having a panic attack and not dealing well with the idea my heart was failing. At the ER they re-did my blood work and did an EKG and both came back normal. They gave me what they called a GI cocktail and that seemed to relieve most of the symptoms for a while. The ER doctor prescribed me the famotidine and sucralfate that evening.I tried the famotidine for the first time today and it seems to help with the symptoms and I'll take it again later tonight. I can pretty much feel this dull burning at all times; either a low-grade simmer I can pretty much ignore or a more concerning flare up especially after food. Sometimes there is no burning sensation, but it's more like a dull pressure with waves of slight nausea and occasional jolts of pain. It seems to be all over my chest cavity, but mostly above the heart area. I have a follow up with my cardiologist scheduled this week.

My hope in this post is that some informed people could give their opinion as to whether this is likely to be a form of heartburn, GERD, acid reflux etc. and what may be causing it. Prior to all this I had an iron stomach, I never got sick and almost never had any acid reflux. When I did on occasion, it felt more like I was going to throw up and a burning at the base of my esophagus, not the left side of my chest. Is what I’m feeling likely a complication from all the medications I’m taking? I’ve been attempting to eat a bland, healthy diet in the last day or so and drink lots of water. It definitely has helped the symptoms but I can pretty much always feel it to some degree. Is there anything in particular I should be asking my doctor when I see him later this week? Thank you so much to whoever takes the time to respond. Bless you.",nausea

But there's a whole class of them. Benzo addiction is very real, serious and [deadly](https://d14rmgtrwzf5a.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/ods2016-slide06.jpg). 1 in 7 deaths by overdose is [benzo related](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates). It's a controlled substance for a good reason.

Here's [wikipedia's description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine)

>Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABAA receptor, **resulting in sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties.** High doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines may also cause anterograde amnesia and **dissociation**. These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating **anxiety, insomnia, agitation.**

Notice any similarities?

That's what you're using PMO for. Self medication. Mainly through [prolactin* and oxytocin](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/could-masturbation-cure-your-insomnia). Both acting as benzos. Ever wonder why masturbation is ""recommended for insomnia"" or ""stress relief""? Why so many masturbate before going to sleep? Why after masturbation you just don't give a fck about anything for a while? It's because it works. *Masturbation is an excellent sedative*.

\* [ prolactin manifests significant relationship to dissociative symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17984948), just like high doses of benzos do.

But using it as such is a dumbfucking bad idea. Because you're misusing a body function designed for something else entirely (sex/bonding) to alleviate stress. That's like saying ""alcohol is great for anxiety""... yes.. it is for the first hour or so. Then you're still anxious as fck and you just learn to be dependent on alcohol to relax. That's how an alcohol addiction is born. Same thing for comfort eating and many more.

And that's what you're using PMO for. I'm more inclined to believe **PMO is used primarily as SEDATIVE** and secondarily as OPIATE (pleasure). At the end of the day it's two powerful drugs in one.",amnesia

8zg1sj,"Hello! This is mostly a curiosity thing because I've been to the doctor multiple times about it and they haven't done anything. I'm a 21 year old white female living in the US, 5'6"" and about 150lbs. I have seasonal allergies and asthma for which I take 10mg montelukast and 5mg levocetirizine daily, as well as albuterol before exercise and often before I go to bed because I get wheezy.

When I was younger I was diagnosed with a heart murmur. Over a few years I had 4 echocardiograms that didn't show anything, and a few EKGs as well that came out normal. My palpitation issue isn't related to this though I don't think. Basically, occassionally when I'm doing very strenuous exercise (sprinting while playing soccer) and once while I was taking a hot shower, my heart rate climbs dramatically (definitely over 200bpm) and my heart feels all fluttery rather than beating strongly like normal, and I start feeling weird tingling in a lot of my joints, mainly my elbows. This has been happening for at least 5 years if not more. My doctor gave me a few techniques to try and get it to stop when it happens, namely bearing down as if I were trying to force a bowel movement, but nothing really works and my heart rate eventually returns to normal by itself within 5-10 minutes. Stopping whatever exercise I'm doing vs. continuing to play doesn't seem to affect when it stops. My resting heart rate is normally in the mid 40s to low 50s, which I've been told by several doctors is fine. 

Two years ago when I brought the palpitation thing up to the cardiologist I was referred to by my GP, she had me wear a heart monitor for two weeks. I played as many soccer games as I could during that time, but because the issue is so intermittent and unpredictable I never managed to make it happen while I was wearing the monitor. The doctor just kind of shrugged and said if I wasn't feeling faint or collapsing when it happened and if it stopped within 15 minutes not to worry about it, none of which has happened. But it does still happen - just yesterday during a soccer game it did, for example. 

Any thoughts? I generally trust the doctor that I shouldn't be too worried, but it is uncomfortable and makes me wonder if someday I will actually collapse. Thanks in advance!",wheezy

Because she got all snappy and grumpy and I was just feeling like we were both dealing with the same level of head pain, but I wasn't acting like that.

And now I can only work 4 hours a day and every time I leave work so early I feel this sense of grief and loss. Some days I wonder if I'll ever be able to grieve everything and get it all done with.

No, not really. Same old bullshit. Angry, agitated, depressed, more anxious. This always, always, *always* happens to me on SSRIs. I'm either cycling, depressed, or hypomanic (thanks a lot Paxil).

I am absolutely *not* going up to 10 mg as I can feel disaster brewing already. I'm losing interest in things I usually find enjoyable (guitar, biking, Fortnite, work, etc.) and instead I'm sleeping in too late, being irrationally pissed off with my family, my situation, and everything that's been going on lately.

I've continually doubted my ""bipolar II"" diagnosis, but it seems to be rearing its ugly head again now that I'm back on an SSRI. I'm already on a mood stabilizer (lamotrigine 100 mg), but truthfully I find it has little to no effect on my mood and it makes me cognitively slower, which I detest.

Vyvanse was working beautifully before Lexapro kicked in. Now it just adds fuel to the fire, making me generally more irritable as opposed to helping me focus like it did before. Take note: Vyvanse did not trigger these symptoms. These new feelings of depression and anger naturally took effect as soon as the ""therapeutic effect"" of Lexapro was supposed to kick in, around six weeks in.

Not sure where to go guys. I don't see any solutions again. Maybe I'll look at the tricyclic antidepressants. Fuck it.",cognitively slower

The second day comes and it is not so great. I get a ridiculous migraine and and my blood pressure just rises like crazy. I go to urgent care and they explain to me that my doctor prescribed too high of a dose to start with and that I need to stop until I see him again.

8y3ins,"I got started up on vyvanse again, today is my second day taking it. It is incredible for my symptoms, but the side effects are unpleasant. Dry mouth, jaw and neck tension, reduced appetite (going on like 40 hours without a meal), and it kept me up til 5 am. 

I dont know what to do. I want to lower my dose, but i also realize this is only the second day. I have a long history with many prescribed adhd meds but not much in recent years.

In a situation like this, would ya'll wait it out and keep taking it to see if the side effects go away, or all a dr today and try to get a lower dose. Or stop taking it? Or try to split the dose? Not sure. I know this sub has rules about asking about dosages and stuff, i briefly read them and hope i am not conflicting any.
Thank you so much for your help!",kept me up til 5 am

8y30wh,"26 years old, 210 pounds, 5'11, Male, Vyvanse 30mg Daily, Not a smoker, No current known medical issues (family is known to have heart problems), issue is just from today. Resting heart rate (from watch) seems to be floating around 88-92.

My diet from yesterday was pure awful, some soda and the better part of a large cheese pizza.

I have had an anal fissure in the past, so the wiping didn't really bother me. I did find it odd though that there doesn't seem to be much blood in the stool, just from wiping. I only got a little worried when I tasted blood in my mouth. It was brief and after drinking some water the taste has now gone away, but I just wanted to check and see if this matches up with anything.

What I'm assuming is that it is somehow related to what I ate yesterday being awful, combined with me taking an additional 30mg of Vyvanse today (which I have been told by my doctor is okay to do on occasion).

Overall, I'm not too worried, but would like to know if it sounds like anything could be going on. I'll admit I could have just thought I tasted blood because I saw it (brains are weird) but w/e. Other than these symptoms nothing else seems off. Maybe just the smallest bit of light headedness, but that is something I have come to expect with Vyvanse.

Thanks in advance!",light headedness
8yqh1o,"Today is day 17 off of Suboxone after taking it for 10 long ass years. The opiate withdrawals are definitely subsiding which is beyond killer. I used kratom to get through the worst of it during the first two weeks, about 25-30 grams a day. This week I've drastically cut down on the kratom to more like 10 grams daily. The past couple days I've been getting horrible anxiety accompanied by a few other symptoms, and a tightness in my chest that won't go away. The left side of my face is super numb too. I should add I'm tapering off of Valium but holding my dose right now. I know the post acute phase can rough mentally but this feels a lot different than other times I've kicked opiates, and it almost feels like benzo withdrawal. Derealization, impaired thinking, paranoia, looping thoughts, tinnitus. Can stopping kratom cause this? I've heard from a few sources that it can act as a calcium channel blocker which is how gabapentin works, and would amp up your CNS and give you benzo type withdrawals. I've also heard that the serotonin effects can cause benzo like symptoms. ",light headedness

She believes worms are infesting muscles in her body. She thinks parts of her body have been eaten away, like her lungs so sometimes she thinks she is suffocating. Now she has gotten even worse. There are episodes mostly in the morning where she just lies on the floor. She feels weak and feels like ""something grabbing at my brain or worms eating her brain"". Doctors just give her anti anxiety and antipsychotic drugs. (Now she takes pregabalin and olanzapine) which make her situation worse because she feels even more weak and frail and her ""worms"" get even stronger.

I have six 2 mg films left to cut down and that is it.  Family said I cannot get more subs to do a softer, less invasive taper.  I am open to any and all suggestions and  would love some support as I get this done to enter sober living.  I have gabapentin, doxepin, baclofen and clonidine to help with the wd's.  I tried cutting the film in half down to 1mg and holy hell I was flip flopping in bed feeling super restless and out of my mind irritable. 

Anyway, today I tool around 1.75.  Will see how it goes.  I read that taking little pieces rather than the whole dose at once helps?  Any links and reading material to educate my family would be appreciated.  I am hoping after reading all the info they may allow me to get a script but I am definitly not counting on it.

8y60qe,"Okay. This is a very long story but I don't know what else to do. 

Thursday I went to the sinus doctor, got a CT scan done and discovered I had many problems. To avoid surgery, I was put on another round of antibiotics(after I had failed three rounds) to try and clear up the problems. I was prescribed a seriously intense brand called Levaquin, which side effects include:  diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hemorrhaging, fainting, etc. The doctor talked about these with me, and although I had no problems in the past, she suggested I take some pro-biotics, so I did. 

The first day of taking these new pills I went out to my favorite Vietnamese place for lunch and had a big steaming bowl of beef  pho with a shrimp spring roll . It was very yummy and I continued my day as normal. I started feeling bad around 5 o'clock and by 6 I vomited everything up so forcefully i had to blow it out my nose (gross, I know). I felt immediately better , thinking I had just had too much to eat, but then i threw up again, this time with diarrhea so bad it was very liquidy. I stopped eating and drinking and just sad on the couch in stomach pain so awful I almost thought about going to the hosptial. My stomach pain reached levels like 7 and 8 on my pain scale, and for me that was pretty high. I continuned to throw up stomach acid until 3am and that was the end of the throw up episode. During this time i had no other symptoms than intense abdominal pain in the belly button/right lower side, vomiting and bad diarrhea. I never ran a fever once.  The next day I slept for about 18 hours. I was still sick to my stomach and had been up pretty late in pain. I drank sips of water but I didnt eat. My stomach muscles were killing me, but I was getting better. I had not touched the pills since the first day. 

The next couple of days I went to work, ate minimally, and slept  a lot. Then, the last 24 hours have been odd. I have started ""spotting"" or bleeding a little. This is odd because I have  very high dose birth control pills that I still managed to take everyday of this illness to prevent me from having month long bleeding cycles. For the sake of this post I am not sexually active. As I have gone to the bathroom through the day I have noticed more and more blood and this is scaring me. I also have awful cramps( something my normal period doesn't come with ). 

Anyway, Im not sure what is going on, but Im afaid something could be seriously messed up. I am not sure if this was all caused by the meds or by the food. I am in so much pain. Please help. Thanks ",vomited

I'm going through the motions of getting diagnosed right now and I'm getting retested for Narcolepsy at the end of the month (last time I was on Seroquel which supresses REM). I have to be off my antidepressants for two weeks before the test. I weened for a few weeks and then had about a week of withdrawal symptoms when I stopped, but once those cleared away, CHRIST.    

I'm more creative than I've been, can think and read faster, and my speech is so much clearer (less garbled, word slurring, etc). It's wonderful. My brains hit a gear that's been missing for a few years, but my body can't keep up with it :/. Still exhausted in every other way.    

Right now I'm in a good headspace, but we'll see how things go with my mood going forward. I'm going to try to stay off them after my test. Either way, I just wanted to share as I'm sure a lot of other CFSers take antidepressants.

8zt662,"Hi everyone. I started Prozac about a month and a bit ago. My doctor increased my dose right before I went back to work a week ago (was on medical leave for a few weeks). 

I worked one shift last week and during the shift I assisted some people to get a large person off the floor. No big deal. The shift was average and I went home happy. Then this past weekend was my boyfriends brothers wedding! Aside from a painful headache, it was a good day. I was feeling anxious, but it was so nice to be a part of. 
So 3 days after my shift, 1 day after the wedding, I get this really intense pain in my side. Can’t get comfortable at all in bed trying to sleep. Eventually I did sleep, but I woke up an hour later in terrible pain. I looked up muscle groups to try to visualize where it was coming from and suddenly I went into a full on panic attack. I woke up my boyfriend and we drove to the ER. When I was finally seen the doctor said I strained a muscle, gave me meds, and sent me on my way. We were there from 3am-7am. 

I was supposed to work that day. I called my manager and told her I wouldn’t be in, and that I thought I hurt myself at work because of the guy who fell. I hadn’t even slept at that point. Now its been a few days and the more I think of it, the less I believe it was work that caused the strain. Why didn’t I have ANY symptoms until 3 days later? They sent me 20 pages of forms for hurt at work injuries and the “what happened” sections are just stressing me out because I feel like I shouldn’t bother filling them out because I genuinely have no clue whether it WAS a work injury. I just feel guilty and overwhelmed. 

I really just want to go back to work. We’re understaffed as it is and I don’t want to cause any more issues. I have an appointment with my family doctor on Thursday and a chiropractor tomorrow. Hoping someone can help me figure out this mess. ",intense pain in my side
8yfdwp,"I’ve been on anxiety medicine for a year now. I started out at 130 pounds on lexapro. The lexapro combined with that good old freshman 15 has caused me to gain 30 pounds since starting starting the medication in August of last year. I switched to prozac in January and found that that helped stop my weight gain.. The problem is, I had to switch back to lexapro because the prozac wasn’t helping my anxiety.

I have since gained five pounds despite eating healthy and running each night without fail. I know that it is because of the prozac because when I was 17 (i’m now 19) I went on a weight loss journey and did everything that I am doing now and managed to lose 20 pounds in 3 months. 

I am weaning myself off of my anxiety because of this weight gain and the fact that I feel I no longer need the medicine, but as you may know it takes a while to wean yourself off of medicine. If you have any advice please help, I have tried everything from calorie counting to a ketogenic diet and I am desperate to find something that works.",gain weight

8yp4gp,"Hello, 

I am a 23 year old white female. 5'2"" and 215lbs (please don't be mean about my weight). Nonsmoker (weed/cigarettes). Diagnosed as bipolar 2. Currently on lithium, lamictal, sertraline, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism induced by lithium, bcp, trazodone and hydroxyzine/lorazepam prn. Started lithium mid April and started levothyroxine at the end of May.

For approx 7-8 weeks I have begun to have migraines/headaches. I have had migraines before now, but not as frequent. I also experience dizziness (but not the room spinning) and lightheadedness. I have extreme fatigue (this has been going on for a long time, but has increased lately). 

I went to see my PCP on July 3rd. She ordered an MRI, as I had difficulty with walking heel to toe as well as flipping my hand over on my left side.

On the morning of July 4th, I woke up and was extremely unsteady. I would almost fall over just from walking normally. I went to urgent care as it was really hot out and I didn't know if I was just dehydrated. Upon exam at urgent care, I guess I had some abnormal signs in the neurology exam (when asked to stand with my eyes closed and my arms out in front of me, I almost immediately began to fall over). They did a CT which came back normal. They also checked my lithium level as well as my kidney function, all which came back normal. They tested for benign positional vertigo and that was ruled out. I was sent to the ER by urgent care as they were concerned about my neuro exam.

At the ER, my neuro exam had worsened slightly (more unsteady, still dizzy). They gave me meclizine (which makes me more dizzy, even at a half dose) and Reglan (which caused agitation) as well as fluids. They sent me home and told me to f/u with PCP. 

I haven't felt any better. MRI w/o contrast was done last night, it was completely normal. I see neurology on Thursday but I don't know what's going on and it's freaking me out.

Additionally, I feel like my left side is ""weird"" when I walk. I tend to fall to the left side. Headaches are all over my head, sometimes on one side and sometimes centralized. I've also had (somewhat rare, but newer) tingling and weird feelings in my hands. Over the last 5 years I've gained 100lbs. I've also had an increasingly hard time concentrating/interpreting sound/words over the last few years. I consistently switch numbers around (i.e. 18 rather than 81). I don't know if any of this is connected. I might just be freaking myself out but I wanted to know if anyone had any ideas before I see neurology.

At the ER, my neuro exam had worsened slightly (more unsteady, still dizzy). They gave me meclizine (which makes me more dizzy, even at a half dose) and Reglan (which caused agitation) as well as fluids. They sent me home and told me to f/u with PCP. 

I haven't felt any better. MRI w/o contrast was done last night, it was completely normal. I see neurology on Thursday but I don't know what's going on and it's freaking me out.

Additionally, I feel like my left side is ""weird"" when I walk. I tend to fall to the left side. Headaches are all over my head, sometimes on one side and sometimes centralized. I've also had (somewhat rare, but newer) tingling and weird feelings in my hands. Over the last 5 years I've gained 100lbs. I've also had an increasingly hard time concentrating/interpreting sound/words over the last few years. I consistently switch numbers around (i.e. 18 rather than 81). I don't know if any of this is connected. I might just be freaking myself out but I wanted to know if anyone had any ideas before I see neurology.

8yp4gp,"Hello, 

I am a 23 year old white female. 5'2"" and 215lbs (please don't be mean about my weight). Nonsmoker (weed/cigarettes). Diagnosed as bipolar 2. Currently on lithium, lamictal, sertraline, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism induced by lithium, bcp, trazodone and hydroxyzine/lorazepam prn. Started lithium mid April and started levothyroxine at the end of May.

For approx 7-8 weeks I have begun to have migraines/headaches. I have had migraines before now, but not as frequent. I also experience dizziness (but not the room spinning) and lightheadedness. I have extreme fatigue (this has been going on for a long time, but has increased lately). 

I went to see my PCP on July 3rd. She ordered an MRI, as I had difficulty with walking heel to toe as well as flipping my hand over on my left side.

On the morning of July 4th, I woke up and was extremely unsteady. I would almost fall over just from walking normally. I went to urgent care as it was really hot out and I didn't know if I was just dehydrated. Upon exam at urgent care, I guess I had some abnormal signs in the neurology exam (when asked to stand with my eyes closed and my arms out in front of me, I almost immediately began to fall over). They did a CT which came back normal. They also checked my lithium level as well as my kidney function, all which came back normal. They tested for benign positional vertigo and that was ruled out.

8zx6zr,"I’m 19 and have been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember. I just recently started seeking treatment for it about 5 months ago after a series of what I now recognize as hypomanic episodes. (binge drinking, shopping and meeting guys are my go to during these said episodes)

After seeing a psychiatrist I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I got started on lexapro which made me super tired and spacey. Then I got switched to Zoloft which made my hypomania and depression worse with some suicidal ideation. I actually ended up taking 20 of those pills and throwing myself into serotonin syndrome and was hospitalized. Then I got put on Effexor which I’m currently on week 3 of taking with no avail.

Talked to my therapist today and she said she thinks I might have bipolar 2. It makes sense to me and would explain why the antidepressants fuck me up. I see my psychiatrist Monday and was just wondering what kind of meds have helped others. The thought of being on antipsychotics really kind of scares me. 

Also has anyone taken adderall with bipolar 2? I think the adderall would really help me be more motivated during the depressive episodes, which is like a majority of the time. ",super tired and spacey

8zr5u3,"I've always chewed my nails, but I never knew it was because of my anxiety. I always thought it was just a habit I never managed to kick. So I tried Sertraline, which made my anxiety 10x worse. Then my doctor switched me to Effexor, of which I am now taking 150mg qday (increase from 75) because my anxiety is skyrocketing again. Nothing has really changed in my work or social life, but I feel like I am constantly on the verge of a panic attack. My mood swings are much closer to the surface. I feel like I did before I started on medication: close to a mental breakdown. I’m hoping the dose increase helps, although I am worried about withdrawal later down the line. I missed a couple of doses and had some withdrawal symptoms, so I’m not really looking forward to eventually getting off of it.

8zbap8,"I have been taking Cipralex for almost two years now, having bumped up to 20mg about four months ago. I have been wanting to come off of it for a while because I have had awful crashes whenever I have increased my dose (however, doc recommended I try maxing it out first). Now, I've been feeling good and pretty steady, however I have really noticed a significant decrease in sexual interest and function as soon as the 20mg started taking effect, so much so that I want to try something else or stop taking antidepressants altogether for a while in hopes that my libido will return. I have been doing some reading and have heard good things about Effexor, Pristiq, and Trintellix in terms of side effects in general (aside from withdrawal from Effexor). Just wondering what experiences people have had with any or experiences with discontinuing antidepressants. Thank you!

For reference, I am a 23 y/o female doing her Master's degree. It is usually a one year program which I have opted to do in two years instead, so my stress levels will overall be much lower in the upcoming year (compared to the time I have been taking Cipralex so far). I have tried Wellbutrin in combination with Cipralex to increase motivation and energy, but had an allergic reaction to it (still disappointed). ",decrease in sexual interest and function

8y7dy7,"I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for basically as long as I can remember in my 24 year lifespan though the first time I can consciously remember being like yup this is that was when I was 11. But that's not important, what's important is that last December I finally went to my doctor and tried to get medicated. Since December I've been on 3 different medications to treat my brain, cipralex for 4.5 months and it made me sleep 18 hours a day, Effexor for 4.5 weeks that either did jack shit or made it worse because I was suicidal and I got off that ASAP when I realized I was just sitting there trying to figure out how to kill myself without making anyone sad, and now Prozac for the last 2ish weeks. Now you may be thinking ah worst 2 weeks, 2 weeks on Prozac, maybe some relation? Not as far as I know, this is all just background, setting the stage. 

So 2 weeks ago, on June 29 I switched meds from the Effexor to Prozac. For 3 days I experienced some hellish withdrawal symptoms or something because I felt like I was drunk off my ass while standing on a boat in the middle of a hurricane. On July 3, my boyfriend and I broke up after just over a year together. It was mutual, it was amicable, but I was still devastated and  was basically catatonic, not able to do anything without sobbing for 2-3 days. I went through 3 boxes of Kleenex. When I finally got a bit of a handle on that I went back to trying to function and finally checked my email again while working on yet another draft of my current chapter for my masters thesis. It was then that I discovered on the 2nd my advisor had communicated with my schools admin and told them I needed to be put on medical leave. Now I know my work for the last god knows how long has been subpar, sleeping 18 hours a day, being suicidal, and/or being too anxious to function will do that, so here I am feeling as if I'm the biggest disappointment and failure. I eventually come to realize no, this is the absolute best thing I could do right now, take the rest of the semester, move back home, get my head on straight, work on my self care and have a plan and really come back and just kill it. So I started filling out the paperwork and getting all the signatures I needed, all of admin was incredibly understanding and kind and helpful. Then it comes time to get my advisors signature. Turns out she actually wants to drop me from my MSc. She's is currently ""deciding"" if she's going to put me down for permanent or temporary withdrawal from my masters as she believes that a month and a half will not be enough time for me to get my shit together and her funding for my project will run out in the new year. I understand where she's coming from with the funding thing, I do, but I've spent the last 2 years working on this thesis and if she forces me to drop to the course based masters, I'm still at least 2 semesters from being done, I still have to keep paying tuition and taking more courses, and then all of a sudden the work I've done just gets downgraded from a thesis that I've poured my heart and soul into for 2 years into a ""project"". I suggested I could come back part time instead of full time so she's no longer obligated to pay me. Because her funding would run out and she needs results from that she'd give my thesis topic to someone else to completely redo and write, on top of their own work, and I would have to start over. She'd rather give my masters thesis topic to someone who is already working on their Phd than give me a chance to prove to her that I can finish it.

I'm currently just waiting to find out if she'll believe in me or not. Now I'm not saying I necessarily deserve belief, I have been incredibly disappointing to her and myself, but why is it that everyone else is understanding just not her? This isn't even uncommon apparently, I don't even need to provide medical proof admin will just take it at face value, but all of a sudden one and a half months of not working makes the difference between being able to finish or not? 

I'm sorry. I know this ended up ranty. I just needed to say something to someone somewhere because I can't make the thoughts stop racing telling me I'm a failure and a disappointment and that I should just give up now and withdraw myself and not bother anyone ever again. I don't even know what I've said. I think I'm mid breakdown. It's 2:30am and I can't sleep I just thought writing it out might've helped. ",suicidal

I usually don't like my dad being in my life, but we discussed my history of Anxiety, depression, Aspergers and Tourettes.  

Before seeing a new doctor, I had been on Effexor (150 MGs) for about 2 years prior and been happy with it. It doesn't nessesarily make me happier, but it numbs it and helps me sleep a lot.  


I went from 150 of Effexor to what he prescribed me with Cymbalta (Which I was on 100 MGs for a month). Which, like the other drugs, never really did anything (this is why I like SSRI's, because they're more aggressive). A month later (AKA a week ago) we decided to try Pristiq. Apparently the FDA is iffy on letting it by covered by most health insurance companies.  

  
I know it's only been a week and I need to give it more time, however, I've been getting the disorientation, mild brain-zaps and dizziness when standing and walking. Is anyone here an expert on Pristiq? Can I just jump start to 100 MG's without any side effects? I can't stand being on this low of a dose.

Is anyone here an expert on Pristiq? Can I just jump start to 100 MG's without any side effects? I can't stand being on this low of a dose.

I’ve been taking Effexor XR 150mg for a few years now, had worsening depression and anxiety for the last few months so a new psych that I visited upped my Effexor to another 75mg dose in the afternoon and added Gabapentin 100mg three times daily. 

I’ve been taking the increased Effexor dose for about a month without seeing many side effects. However, I just started taking the Gabapentin a few days ago and am not sure what to think. The first day I felt very groggy and out of it, but definitely decreased anxiety which was a plus. However, the following few days I actually felt hyper...almost manic and keyed-up. Definitely not what I want from an anti-anxiety standpoint haha. Not sure what this means considering it makes almost everyone drowsy and calm...weird reaction to the Gaba or the mix of Effexor+Gaba? Contacted psych but no response yet. ",groggy

Vyvanse is the only other pharmaceutical drug available but it's expensive and not worth it. Cocaine is available too but doesn't seem to fit the purpose of concentration/learning.

What do you think of methylone? My plan is to take 50-70mg before studying. it's a cathinone with way more dopamine activity than mdma but way less serotonin release which makes me believe this renders it relatively safe to do once a week or twice and the dopamine effect might play a role in concentration similar to how amphetamines sometimes act as reuptake inhibitors.
